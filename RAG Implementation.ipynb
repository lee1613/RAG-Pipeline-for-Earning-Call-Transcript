This allows me to start with the business update. On Slide 6, you see and it's a reminder, the design of the Phase 3 study the TRYbeCA-1 study. It is as you know, pivotal randomized Phase 3 trial where we compare the standard of care chemotherapy, which can be gemcitabine with Abraxane or a combination of 5FU, leucovorin and oxaliplatin FOLFIRI.

We spoke earlier about partnerships, and talked to you about Ford's closest partnership, which is Argo AI, and Ford's AV LLC. Understand that those are not under your purview today. But what we really want to focus on is knowledge sharing. So how is Ford thinking about sharing the learnings between those groups?

In his role as CTO, Dr. Washington is charged with overseeing the development and implementation of the company's technology strategy, as well as overseeing the Ford's next-gen vehicle architectures and controls and automated systems. For a quick background on Ford autonomous ambition, Argo AI was born out of Ford's 2017 investment in Argo, and has been developed in-house by Ford over the past several years until Q2 of this year, when Ford finalized an agreement with Volkswagen to create a joint venture.

      " Based on the provided contexts, here are summaries for the segments that pertain to AMD's earnings call:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reportedly, AMD has a significant ramp coming into the second half of the year, spanning multiple product lines and businesses. They have strong demand and are performing as expected, despite not being able to comment on specific products or customers. The Data Center and Server CPU markets are growth drivers for AMD, especially with the adoption of the EPYC processor line (Context 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "8. AMD reached up to a double-digit market share (10%) in the Server CPU market, as they had promised to hit that target in the June quarter. They expanded their presence despite not announcing a new market share target (Context 7).\n",
      "\n",
      "17. The macroeconomic situation, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, has impacted AMD's business. However, there seems to be a pull-in from work-from-home and cloud sectors, which has helped offset some of the challenges. Overall, the company maintains high productivity and is on track with its product development, amidst the evolving environment (Context 17).\n",
      "\n",
      "35. AMD attributes its market share gains to the high-performance Zen CPU core architecture, improvements in the instruction per clock cycle, and advanced manufacturing processes. These factors, combined with a competitive product roadmap, contribute to their strong market position and future growth potential (Context 39).\n",
      "\n",
      "These contexts indicate AMD's strong market position, particularly in the data center and server CPU markets, and their ongoing strategies and performance in a challenging macroeconomic environment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Given the 46 contexts, there are 4 relevant documents. Therefore, the Recall@50 is calculated as:\n",
      "\n",
      "Recall@50 = Number of relevant documents / 46 = 4 / 46 ≈ 0.087 or 8.7% \n",
      "\n",
      "This calculation indicates that about 8.7% of the provided contexts are relevant to the AMD earnings call transcript.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is based on the context:\n",
      "1. and speculation that about your semi-custom business and while I realize that's not exactly the topic of the day that we're going to be addressing here, I wondered if you could comment a little bit about those reports?Well look, you know as we've commented before, we have a very large ramp coming into the second half of the year, across multiple product lines, really across every business. And you know I can't really comment on any specific product or any specific customer, but demand continues to be extremely strong and the ramp is going about as we expected.Great! Thanks for addressing that in general. So why donâ€™t we dive a little bit deeper into your business. So the Datacenter market and the Server CPU market specifically, those have been great growth drivers for AMD over the last\n",

It seems like you have two big, positive big tailwinds that you didn't have when you were going from zero to 5% or from 5% to 10%. So with those tailwinds there, maybe just smile if you agree.Well, look I want to drive this business as hard as we possibly can. We've got a great, great product roadmap to do it.Perfect! So letâ€™s talk about the competition side of things. How does pricing enter this equation? Unfortunately I'm old enough to remember the last time when AMD did hit that kind of upper 20â€™s market share and the response at that point from your primary competitor\n",

We've established a strong foundation to meet our ambitious targets and stakeholder expectations for profitable growth as we deliver significant shareholder value. As we continue on our path to realizing our boldly back on track vision, are now complete management team and our employees are excited about the opportunities then we have in front of us. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator?At this time, we will be\n",

      "4. we've got a strong set of products, we are in a strong shared growth mode here, particularly with the -- well not particularly, both on the client side, as well as on the enterprise side, and so I think from our point of view weâ€™re little less affected by the macro market factors and we are more focused on how do we continue to execute the projects that we've already won and make sure that those deployments go seamlessly. And then secondly, regardless of what happens in the market, we got to gain share, and I think we've got the product and the roadmap to do it.So when you talk about that share gain dynamics, I want to dive into some of the technology side of that equation and what's driven that? Obviously there's a huge attribution given to the manufacturing node, not only your success\n",
      "\n",
      "5. that kind of upper 20â€™s market share and the response at that point from your primary competitor was for a period of time to get very aggressive on the pricing side, and that kind of you know damaged the market temporarily for both, but really hurt AMD somewhat structurally. There's a thousand things that are different this time, but how do you think pricing enters this equation and are you seeing any change in the behavior on that front?Look, you know I think we've always anticipated, you know there's a lot of scar tissue here at AMD, you know competing with Intel for many years and theyâ€™re a fantastic company, a great competitor. So you know weâ€™ve always expected the environment to be extremely competitive and I would say that it's about what we expect.  But the thing to keep in\n",

I think AMD deserves a huge congratulations of hitting up to the 10% or double digit market share in the June quarter that you guys had promised. I know you're not going to give whatever the new market share target is.

There's big picture, debates\n",

The company's President and CEO, Andrea Greenberg, will begin this morning's call with a discussion of the company's operations. This will be followed by a review of financial results of Bret Richter, the company's EVP, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. After their prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions.

But before we do that, I've been asking all the companies a few macro related questions given the interesting year 2020 has turned out to be.  So the first topic and we were talking a little bit before the cameras turned on here about COVID and being back in the office, etc. So how has the COVID pandemic, as tragic as itâ€™s been, impacted your business? Has there been pull-ins from the work-from-home and the cloud side of things or pushed out demand, because new workloads are having a difficult time launching at a time when everybody's just trying to remove uncertainty. What have been the puts\n",

      "18. Stewart.Yes. I think, as we said, the revenues are encouraging well, recovering. They're not where they are or not where they were before, but they're on their way up, and SG&A is on its way down on a long-term trend. The other big component of that is CapEx and actually we're seeing opportunities. And again, if we look for silver linings, itâ€™s the â€“ I think CapEx will be reduced over the next 12 months compared to where it would have been. We don't make predictions. We don't put them down in terms of when free cash flow has come back on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But if you think about those different components, I think, you can see that we've got a clear path to getting back there in a relatively short-term.Thatâ€™s it for me guys. I'll turn it over. Thanks. Good luck.This\n",

      "19. and will be in a good position going forward. Most importantly, our business -- financial position is still healthy. We have sufficient financial position to plan and invest for the future. And today, we are generating also positive cash flow. So we are not worried that any short-term impact will cause us to lose focus on executing our long-term strategy.There are no further questions at this moment. I will now hand the call back to the CEO, Mr. Victor Li, for the closing remarks.Thank you, operator. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you next time.Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\n",

And in fact, in all our trials, we exceed this level by a very wide margin for a long period of time.Got you. Thanks for taking my questions.Thank you for asking.I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Gil Beyen for closing remarks.Great. I just want to thank everyone for your participation and attention and questions, obviously. Thanks also for your continued support.

It was a -- it is a service based company and therefore, it affects the ratios between services and software.Okay. Thanks. Can you -- I guess can you extend that and talk to what you see going forward in M&A? I mean, you guys have a ton of cash still. I know you've been very, very careful about picking and choosing. And I know all your investors appreciate that. I was just wondering if youâ€™re thinking about becoming more aggressive, because I mean other companies are clearly not going to be in the same financial strength that you are, and they might be willing to negotiate more closely. Could you speak to that a little [Multiple Speakers]â€¦We definitely look\n",

It's just a question of, I mean, there's lots of questions around that, but yes, we always keep an open mind to these types of transactions, and yes, there are opportunities out there.Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. When we think of your expansion geographically, are you -- you have enough in the vicinity of your, in province of Alberta? Or are you looking further in other regions in Canada or even in the U.S. what's your sense of that?Yes. So, we're very happy with the states we have now, but we also always keep a pipeline of potential new sites as there may be good opportunities to expand beyond our current capacity. What I'll say is, we are\n",

      "23. on site and everything related to actually bringing that Bitcoin to the Company. And so a lot of these measures that we're doing in terms of reducing costs at site are also going to be reducing the cost per Bitcoin as well. So, that's another factor that that I would mention. So, that's answer your question there and I can move on to question number two as well. I'll take that as a yes.Yes.Thank you. In terms of the second point, the first thing I'll mention about the CEO search is that I'm not an active part in it. So, I can only speak to a certain level to it. The Board I know is active in the search. It is taking some time as it is a key decision. But thinking through, I think that's about all I can say, they are actively working on it. And it is a priority to them. But, I don't have\n",

So -- and they don't go to FID until 2022. But we're told that it's coming. So we're waiting for it. We expect it to come this year. So that's -- that -- once we have that new draft to the PPA, we would then move to execute on the Taipower PPA.  At the same time, we've been in discussions with commercial offtakers for a commercial PPA for those projects, which you'd expect would have to be at enhanced economics, otherwise, we wouldn't enter into that. So that's what's going on right now. David Povall is on the line. He's closer to it. But is there anything that I've left out, David?No, thank you, Mike. I know you've covered it\n",

      "25. it cost us a little money, the technical resources and we just refocus them on the businesses that were actually up and running and you can see from the results, that probably was â€“ was probably a smart thing to do.Okay, great. Lastly, just on the announcement with the Western Canada Lottery Corporation. Brooks, are there other opportunities like this in these types of markets? I know you kind of walk through some of the strategic drivers in the near-term, but are there other opportunities, I guess, in North America to have some of these major placements like you announced here?Yes. I mean, I think certainly one of the things that we wanted to do was, I think Chad as you know, our results in Illinois has been extremely strong. And obviously, we kept all of the potential customers aware\n",

      "26. you. Our next question comes from Deepak Kaushal [ph]. Please go ahead.Hi, Jimmy. Sorry. I joined a bit late, so if I ask any repeat questions, I apologize. But I wanted to get your sense of the M&A environment now that we're well post halving and with kind of COVID environment. What kind of changes are you seeing and how are you guys thinking about M&A these days? Is it in the playbook?Yes. So, we always keep an open mind in terms of all the different ways that we can grow. And so, just speaking at a high level, here's our view, eight years ago, there was a lot of basement miners and that was the way that people mined bitcoin. And then, big scale is, it was crazy for someone to open up a two megawatt facility and actually go to more of an industrial level. And so, now past this halving,\n",

That we would see a hit to productivity, that we would see you know really a slowdown in our ability to get things done. I've been very pleased by seeing quite the contrary.  I mean I think if anything, productivity maybe slightly up. You know people are traveling less, people are more available and we've had even for development of new products, we've had you know the engineers and the whole team really rise to the occasion, embrace these new tools, embrace the new normal and I think we've been able to maintain a high degree of productivity and keep the products on track.You and I were talking a little bit\n",

As our digital technical services continue to build momentum, we'll also maintain our focus on reducing our credit balance for our risk-sharing services, and we expect this combination of efforts to gradually improve our profitability over the long-term. Despite the current market challenges, we remain steadfast in our belief that our significant competitive advantages in technological innovation and financial services will continue to fuel the resiliency of our business, allow us to continue executing our development strategies and set a stage for return to growth in the coming year. With that, I'll turn the call over\n",

Can we open up the call for questions, please?[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of John Janedis with Wolfe Research.Hi. This is Se filling in for John. I had two questions. You renewed two deals last year, and there continues to be pressure on the bundle. Can you talk about the potential to be re-tiered? And whether you see this as a risk going forward?Adam, do you want to take that one?Sure. So â€“ yes, I mean, as you point out, we've successfully renewed two deals in the past fiscal year. We have a long track record of successfully renewing our affiliate agreements. We've successfully renewed four of our top five\n",

      "30. keep as many costs from coming back as we can. I think like everyone, we've seen ways of operating during the lockdown time and there's ways of eliminating costs. So clearly, not all costs will come back. And yes, it's difficult to quantify at the moment exactly how much of that will be. Itâ€™s certainly a challenge of ours. And I'd say it's going to be a meaningful number, and itâ€™ll be a seven-digit number per quarter, but putting an exact number on that isâ€¦And then last one for me. So it seems encouraging performance metrics since reopening. Any commentary you can give about when we can expect an inflection back to free cash flow generation?Well, I think â€“ you want me to take that one?Yes.Yes, Stewart.Yes.

      "31. we don't have access to that information, but I think something that is kind of interesting is what we see. Because we're Server-Based, we can actually see kind of every keystroke. So what we're seeing is that people are coming into the â€“ to use our products and are actually staying significantly longer than they had stayed in the past and are spending more money when they're in the facilities. But we believe that they're actually maybe going less frequently than they have in the past, which kind of, if you take the combination of all that is probably explains a fair bit about the recovery, but also, hopefully will make it such that as more and more people get comfortable going into these environments that we could see an uplift as well.Okay. That makes sense. Thanks Brooks. On the cost\n",

And then the second question is around the 87,000 net adds and the outperformance versus your main competitor. I think you've already given some explanations earlier to Dominik's question. But, I was wondering if there's any data you could share with us. I believe you don't track NPS, but any customer satisfaction surveys you are doing and whether you are starting to see a shift versus the performance of your competitors? Thank you.Let me start with the first part of the question. And maybe Christian, you might help me then on this one.

Our turnover is plus/minus â‚¬1 billion. And the complexity starts with a number of production sites. We have 29 production sites. We have a full company setup and we look - or we ask ourselves the question, which is the right size of this company.  But an answer we will give mid of Q4. Am I missing something?No.Okay. I hope, Christian, I answered your question.Okay. Yeah, thank you very much for the time being and all the best.

Turning to Slide 5, we posted revenue of $72.5 million for the quarter as Tracy mentioned. Sales rose slightly year-over-year reflecting continued work on the Vogtle sites as well as $7 billion of additional decommissioning work and $5 million of higher revenue from Canada. Those gains were largely offset by the timing of a scheduled outage with one of our utility customers. We continue to forecast that our Vogtle work will run at a rate of roughly $25 million to $30 million per quarter this year, although itâ€™s nearly $32 million this period and about the same in Q1. As Tracy indicated, we are not seeing\n",

So putting those things together, you know we're very confident in growing that market quite a bit.Great! Well Forrest, time went really fast on us. Thank you very much for taking the time. It was great chatting with you on this. Congratulations about the great growth in your business and we look forward to monitoring it going forward, whatever the slope may be.

And on top of that, we are now learning how to gear up the FTTH rollout in a much more productive and efficient way. And that is what I'm trying. I want to approach this business unit with a more kind of factory approach. That means, get more for the same amount of money. We are not providing a new CapEx envelope today for next year.

However, we are pursuing some promising opportunities with new customers and our existing customers continue to award us additional work.

We'll obviously continued to be focused on cost containment and efficient use of resources as we get through this period, however, we remain optimistic for the rest of the year and are reaffirming our previously issued guidance.

You know I think that going back you have to look at the resurgence of AMD as the fruits, you know from the seeds that were planted back in really quite frankly 2012, when Mark Papermaster and Lisa Su came in, one of the first things they did in 2012 before Lisa was even CEO, was kick off the generation of the new high performance CPU core engines.  So the Zen CPU Core Roadmap is absolutely critical and that when we introduced it in 2017, you know it was over a 50% improvement and instructions per clock cycle from our, the predecessor product. And so that has nothing to do with the process. That's entirely the architecture and the implementation of the design, independent of clock speed and independent of process.  And so I think you\n",

And there were some currency headwinds which we had to face, which basically qualify for almost -- for more than half of that revenue decline. However, if the team was able to basically respond to that topline challenge by rigorous cost management and that helped the European segment on an organic basis to basically show a consecutive EBITDA growth now for the tenth consecutive quarter; by the way I forgot to mention this Germany is now on quarter 15 with consecutive growth.

So the transaction price of the call option was zero. Therefore, it's -- the recognition on the balance sheet is also zero. So there's no net debt increase. But there is a difference between the transaction value and the fair value and that's roughly â‚¬1 billion.

My first one is another one on working capital. And I know it'll be a tough one to ask. So, I would ask it anyway. So, we can probably split the working capital dynamics into three different buckets.

Since this is my first call as the CEO of SGL Carbon, I would like to take a few minutes to share with you some information about myself, my management style and what my first thoughts are after 10 weeks at SGL Carbon. I was born and raised in the northern German city of Bremen, where I also studied and completed my PhD in chemistry. I started my professional career at Bayer as a laboratory manager, and in total I spent 10 years at Bayer in various roles, followed by another 10 years at LANXESS in different operational and administrative positions. Most recently, I was CEO of SALTIGO, a subsidiary of LANXESS AG, which manufactures precursors for pharmaceuticals and agricultural products.

But you know as well or even better as I do that SGL has repeatedly disappointed capital markets expectations and that COVID-19 and its aftereffects will be a new challenge we all have to deal with. Essentially, SGL Carbon's profitability level is too low and we have to identify how we can lift our earnings. I also get the feeling that the administrative structures and the processes are a bit over-engineered for a midsized company like SGL Carbon. Next Page please. To address this I have developed, over the years, very simple but clear principles for how I manage businesses entrusted to me. This is business first; keep it simple; (Distance: 17.5777)\n",

      "The response is:\n",
      " Answer:\n",
      "Based on the provided segments, here are the main content points from the AMD earnings call transcript:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Supply Chain and Market Share**:\n",
      "   - AMD has secured its supply chain, from wafers to substrates, to meet product demand.\n",
      "   - The company achieved a significant milestone by reaching double-digit market share (10%) in the Server CPU market in the June quarter, a goal they had previously set.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Product Roadmap and Execution**:\n",
      "   - The introduction of the second-generation EPYC processors (Rome) was critical for AMD’s resurgence, offering double the performance of competitors and demonstrating AMD’s ability to deliver on promises.\n",
      "   - The third-generation EPYC processors (Milan) are important for maintaining trust and continued adoption, as they further demonstrate AMD's commitment to its roadmap and performance improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Business Impact of COVID-19**:\n",
      "   - The pandemic has had mixed effects on AMD's business, with some segments experiencing pull-ins from work-from-home and cloud demand, while others have faced challenges in launching new workloads due to uncertainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Competition and Pricing**:\n",
      "   - AMD remains focused on executing its strategy and assumes strong competition. The company’s primary competitor's recent manufacturing issues have not significantly altered AMD's strategic approach.\n",
      "   - Pricing is a factor in the competitive landscape, but AMD emphasizes the importance of performance and reliability in driving adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Future Aspirations**:\n",
      "   - AMD sees GPUs as a critical driver of growth in the datacenter market and plans to be thoughtful about resource allocation to ensure strong performance in both CPU and GPU segments.\n",
      "   - The company is committed to expanding its market share and maintaining a strong presence in the datacenter and server CPU markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Historical Context**:\n",
      "   - The resurgence of AMD is attributed to the seeds planted in 2012 when new leadership introduced the Zen CPU Core Roadmap, which provided a significant improvement in performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Financial and Operational Highlights**:\n",
      "   - AMD is focused on maintaining financial discipline and operational efficiency while pursuing growth opportunities and diversifying its business.\n",
      "\n",
      "These points summarize the key discussions and themes from the AMD earnings call, highlighting the company's strategic focus, market performance, and future outlook. \n",
      "\n",
      "To calculate the Recall@50, we need to determine how many of these segments are relevant to the AMD earnings call and then divide by 46.\n",
      "\n",
      "Relevant segments:\n",
      "1. Supply Chain and Market Share\n",
      "2. Product Roadmap and Execution\n",
      "3. Business Impact of COVID-19\n",
      "4. Competition and Pricing\n",
      "5. Future Aspirations\n",
      "6. Historical Context\n",
      "7. Financial and Operational Highlights\n",
      "\n",
      "There are 7 relevant segments out of 50 provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recall@50 = Number of relevant documents / 46\n",
      "Recall@50 = 7 / 46 ≈ 0.1522 or 15.22%\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the Recall@50 is approximately 15.22%.\n",

      "The answer is based on the context:\n",
      "1. and I think weâ€™ve commented, supply is sufficient, but â€“ you know but it's tied, the places of premium on planning for ourselves as well as planning for our consumers, but we think we've got the supply chain, lined up from wafers to substrates and you know everything in between to hit our goods [ph].So let's pivot over to the Server CPU market specifically and some of the market share side of things. I think AMD deserves a huge congratulations of hitting up to the 10% or double digit market share in the June quarter that you guys had promised. I know you're not going to give whatever the new market share target is. I think at the last event that I actually physically attended within the industry was your analyst meeting back in early March and no such number was given at that time.\n",

And you know I can't really comment on any specific product or any specific customer, but demand continues to be extremely strong and the ramp is going about as we expected.Great! Thanks for addressing that in general. So why donâ€™t we dive a little bit deeper into your business. So the Datacenter market and the Server CPU market specifically, those have been great growth drivers for AMD over the last\n",

It was getting to having people used to AMD back into the market, was having customers believe that we could deliver a high performance, a component, whether we were doing what we set, and to that end Rome was hugely important, the second generation EPYC processors that we introduced last August, it was hugely important. Not just because it's a great product and you know really the 64 cores offers literally double the performance of our principal competitors offerings at that point in time, so just about the same.  Not only offering literally double the performance, the other critical part of Rome is it's exactly what we said we were going to do, and that predictability of execution gives customers confidence that they can invest in putting AMD into their\n",

So the Zen CPU Core Roadmap is absolutely critical and that when we introduced it in 2017, you know it was over a 50% improvement and instructions per clock cycle from our, the predecessor product.

Turning to Slide 5, we posted revenue of $72.5 million for the quarter as Tracy mentioned.

We also generated a total adjusted EBITDA of $316 million, an increase of $119 million, or 61%, from the same period of last year.

In our press release issued today, we announced that Magic Software Enterprise Board of Directors has declared a semiannual cash dividend in the amount of $0.175 per share and in the aggregate amount of approximately $8.6 million for the first half of 2020, reflecting approximately 75% of our net income and 30% of our cash flow from operating\n",

As in our last outlook, the figure does not take into account one-time restructuring expenses which could result in up to â‚¬40 million.

Essentially, SGL Carbon's profitability level is too low and we have to identify how we can lift our earnings. I also get the feeling that the administrative structures and the processes are a bit over-engineered for a midsized company like SGL Carbon. Next Page please.

      "Based on the provided snippets, I can summarize the key points from the earning call transcript for AMD:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Supply Chain and Market Share**: AMD has successfully lined up its supply chain, from wafers to substrates, to meet its goals. The company has achieved a significant market share milestone, with double-digit market share in the server CPU market, particularly with its EPYC processors. The introduction of the second-generation EPYC processors (Rome) has been crucial, offering double the performance of competitors and reinforcing customer confidence in AMD's execution and reliability.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Product Roadmap and Execution**: The Zen CPU Core Roadmap, introduced in 2017, has been a critical factor in AMD's resurgence. The Zen architecture provided a significant improvement in performance, which has driven AMD's success. The company's focus on consistent execution and meeting roadmaps has built trust with customers and the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Future Outlook and Strategy**: AMD is continuing to focus on its strategic plan, including the upcoming third-generation EPYC processors (Milan). The company emphasizes the importance of delivering on its promises and maintaining a competitive edge through high-performance products and reliable execution. The confidence in the roadmap and the company's ability to deliver is driving rapid adoption in the data center market.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Market Impact and Demand**: The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the market, but AMD has seen strong demand, particularly in the work-from-home and cloud segments. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends with its high-performance offerings.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Financial Performance**: The company's financial results have been strong, with significant growth in revenue and profitability. The ramp in various product lines, including the EPYC processors, has contributed to this success. AMD is also maintaining strict cost discipline and financial discipline to ensure long-term sustainability.\n",
      "\n",
      "These points highlight AMD's strategy, market position, and financial performance, emphasizing the company's focus on consistent execution and high-performance products to drive market share and growth. \n",
      "\n",
      "To calculate the Recall@50, we need to determine how many of the provided snippets are relevant to the AMD earning call. Assuming the relevant snippets are 1, 3, 5, 6, 11, 16, 22, 23, 32, 36, and 37 (11 relevant snippets):\n",

      "\\[ \\text{Recall@50} = \\frac{\\text{Number of relevant documents}}{46} = \\frac{11}{46} = 0.2391 \\]\n",

      "So, the Recall@50 is approximately 0.2391.\n",

      "1. and I think weâ€™ve commented, supply is sufficient, but â€“ you know but it's tied, the places of premium on planning for ourselves as well as planning for our consumers, but we think we've got the supply chain, lined up from wafers to substrates and you know everything in between to hit our goods [ph].So let's pivot over to the Server CPU market specifically and some of the market share side of things. I think AMD deserves a huge congratulations of hitting up to the 10% or double digit market share in the June quarter that you guys had promised. I know you're not going to give whatever the new market share target is. I think at the last event that I actually physically attended within the industry was your analyst meeting back in early March and no such number was given at that time.\n",

Not just because it's a great product and you know really the 64 cores offers literally double the performance of our principal competitors offerings at that point in time, so just about the same.  Not only offering literally double the performance, the other critical part of Rome is it's exactly what we said we were going to do, and that predictability of execution gives customers confidence that they can invest in putting AMD into their\n",

So the Zen CPU Core Roadmap is absolutely critical and that when we introduced it in 2017, you know it was over a 50% improvement and instructions per clock cycle from our, the predecessor product.

      " Answer:\n",
      "In the context of Ford Motor and autonomous driving, different levels of automation from Level 2 to Level 4 are distinguished by the extent of a vehicle's ability to manage driving tasks and the role of the driver. Here’s a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Level 2 (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems - ADAS):\n",
      "- **Description**: The vehicle can perform some driving tasks, such as steering, accelerating, and braking, but the driver must remain engaged and monitor the driving environment at all times.\n",
      "- **Example**: Ford’s Mustang Mach-E with Co-Pilot 360 and Active Drive Assist. These systems allow for advanced hands-off, eyes-off capabilities on certain highways but still require the driver to be attentive and ready to take control.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Level 3 (Conditional Automation):\n",
      "- **Description**: The vehicle can handle most driving tasks in specific conditions, such as on highways. However, the driver must be ready to take control if the system cannot handle a situation.\n",
      "- **Key Challenge**: The major challenge is ensuring that the driver can be reliably alerted and can regain control of the vehicle when needed.\n",
      "- **Example**: Ford is working on developing a Level 3 solution that will allow drivers to be hands-off, eyes-off, and mind-off, meaning they can engage in other activities like reading a book, but they must be able to take over if the system encounters a situation it cannot handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Level 4 (High Automation):\n",
      "- **Description**: The vehicle is capable of performing all driving tasks and monitoring the driving environment under certain conditions, such as in a geofenced area. No driver intervention is required, and the vehicle can stop safely if it encounters an unhandled situation.\n",
      "- **Example**: Ford’s Level 4 solution, developed in collaboration with Argo AI, will be used in autonomous vehicle fleets for services like ride-sharing and delivery. It will use LiDAR, radar, and cameras to navigate and operate safely without a human driver.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Level 2 involves advanced driver assistance systems that require constant driver attention, Level 3 allows for more automation but still needs the driver to be ready to take control, and Level 4 is a fully autonomous system that can operate without a driver in specific conditions. Ford is actively working on transitioning from Level 2 to Level 3 and ultimately to Level 4, with a focus on ensuring driver safety and system reliability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is based on the context:\n",
      "1. Level 4 and Level 2 were thought of as totally separate activities. And we're seeing those blend together more closely as sensors get more capable and as AI becomes more real. And one of the challenges that we're currently working on, that will be a key milestone is, is the challenge of resolving how can you regain the attention of a driver in a Level 3 solution. We are hard at work on that. We've got lots of activity working with technology partners, as well as our own team in Palo Alto and our team at Dearborn working together on an advanced perception stack as well as a solution that's in the cabin to determine how to regain the attention of the driver, if the attention is required, because some condition exists that the Level 3 system cannot handle.  And just to remind everyone, a\n",
      "\n",
      "2. to take a similar approach, where the added capability comes from enhanced AI processing not moving to LiDAR for a Level 3. So, we only move to LiDAR when we go to Level 4 and thatâ€™s what Argo is using for the tech stack in those vehicles.Okay. That's quite clear. So it's more about the AI, the compute, the fusion as opposed to perception being a bottleneck. Maybe...Correct.That's a different case. Okay. And then, two big themes and I'll pass it back to John. But what we've heard a lot over the last day is, obviously thereâ€™s big opportunity with Level 2+, you just outlined that. But also the main idea of reoccurring revenue streams, that opportunities, because this is now OTA, could you talk about how Ford is thinking about pricing optionality and functionality when it improves\n",
      "\n",
      "3. some condition exists that the Level 3 system cannot handle.  And just to remind everyone, a Level 3 solution is not a full SDS like a Level 4 solution that Argo is working on, it does require a driver to still be responsible in the event that they need to retake control of the vehicle. So I would say the key milestones along the way would be demonstrating that you can regain the attention of a driver if you're bringing a Level 3 solution to market. If you're in the Level 2 domain, weâ€™ve solved most of the immediate challenges and that's why weâ€™ve introduced to the market in our Mustang Mach-E, the Co-Pilot 360 and the Active Drive Assist, because we're really excited about the ability to bring the capability to do an advanced hands-off, eyes-off solution.   So it's an exciting time,\n",
      "\n",
      "4. It's not really my place to do that. But I am aware because I sit as observer on their Board that they have a very, very effective closed loop data ecosystem that has -- that enables their SDS to benefit from continuous learning and for perception as well as for navigation. So, learning between the two is something we're still working out, because we think we get the advantage both of us by having that kind of a solution. So more to come on that.Perfect. And Iâ€™ll -- we've got a bunch of questions here, so I'll try to combine a couple. Do maps have a role in sensor fusion in Level 2 to level 4, and if there a current timeline in place for moving to Level 4 automation from Argo testing to self-driving delivery vehicles?So the Argo-Ford plan is to bring the Level 4 solution to a -- both a\n",
      "\n",
      "5. to bring the capability to do an advanced hands-off, eyes-off solution.   So it's an exciting time, because the capabilities are getting much more mature, we're bringing those to market.Yes, for sure. So one of the things that we've talked about and as Ford is using some of these L2 and L3 or L2++ features in order to entice customers to lower their [biological] footprint, so it's great from our perspective to see that, all those features and Ford has sort of full technological capabilities on display in the Mach-E.Well, I was just going to say that the Mach-E is really -- going to have a really great Level 2 advanced driver assistance solution. But what we're really excited about is the next revolution, or the next evolution of the tech stack, which is going to allow us to do even more\n",
      "\n",
      "6. from Ford. So, sensor, radar, LiDAR, if you could just sort of give us an update what to expect in the drive-assist vehicle?Sure. So let me start with LiDAR, because that's the most straightforward. It's really important in our tech stack for retail and commercial vehicles for it to be affordable. And LiDAR at this point is still not yet at the cost point that we believe can be integrated into a tech stack for commercial or retail customer. It's really dedicated to -- right now, we're really leaving LiDAR to the platform for a SDS autonomous vehicle fleet that will be in a service where the return on costs will be viable business equation. In commercial and retail vehicles that we sell at scale, we believe we can provide a Level 2+ and a Level 3 solution using a clever mix of long range\n",
      "\n",
      "7. production cars and putting sort of Argo AI aside for now. If we focus on this path from Level 2 to Level 4, which the industry has largely pushed back over the years, particularly on Level 3 and Level 4, it raises two key questions for us. Knowing that there's little publicly available data, that's an accurate comparison of progress in the space, how can we think about milestones along the way? And then our second key question is, what are the key bottlenecks as you see it as we move from Level 2 to Level 3 and beyond? Is it sensor tech or AI and cost?Well, it's a super important topic. One of the things we've learned as we've continued our journey in AV is, when we began that journey, Level 4 and Level 2 were thought of as totally separate activities. And we're seeing those blend\n",
      "\n",
      "8. you talk about how Ford is thinking about pricing optionality and functionality when it improves through over-the-air updates? Anything we can think about that, that sort of changes the way that cars are priced and their services are sold in the future?Yes. I really appreciate that question, because this is really, really a key part of our vision and our strategy. So in addition to today, where when you buy the vehicle on day one, you've got this amazing set of capabilities around driver assist and infotainment, that -- so you have right out of the gate, which includes things like Sirius radio and Wi-Fi hotspots.

Maybe if we could talk a little bit about the sensor configuration in EyeQ drive assist, just as a number, physical cameras, radar. And then obviously sort of thinking a little bit ahead, in the past, I think you've had favorable comments about the nature of LiDAR technology. I think that was primarily around AV, the idea of it, with cost reduction that could come into active safety. So, we haven't seen it yet in a production car from Ford.

What we're working on now is, you referred to Level 2++, we're working to crack the barrier between Level 2++ and a true Level 3 solution for highway driving. So we're aiming to have that in the future. We haven't made an announce announcement date yet of course. But it's in our roadmap. So we're moving toward a solution that will allow you to truly be hands-off, eyes-off and mind-off so that you can do other experiences in the vehicle, you can turn your attention to read a book or whatever it might be.

      "The representatives from AMD are not willing to set new benchmarks with fine granularity or provide a slope for the share gain curve. They do aspire over time to exceed their historical high water mark, which was around 26% to 27% unit share, and they believe they have the roadmap to achieve this. However, they are primarily focused on leveraging the momentum they have built with their ecosystem, partners, and customers through the first and second generations of EPYC, and continuing to build on that. They aren't giving a specific timeframe or intermediate milestones for future share gains.\n",

      "1. industry was your analyst meeting back in early March and no such number was given at that time. But I did want to just get your thoughts on the market share side of things.   It took you about six quarters or a year and a half to go from the 5% to the 10% market share. How do you think the slope of that share gain curve looks going forward? Would you be able to double the share again in the same amount of time? Is it more a much fairer way to look at it that adding the incremental five points of share rather than thinking of it as a doubling what happened over that time? Would it happen faster or slower and why?Yes, so you know I think I donâ€™t want to get into the mode of you know setting new benchmarks along the way with fine granularity. I think Iâ€™ve always said about share looking\n",

It seems like you have two big, positive big tailwinds that you didn't have when you were going from zero to 5% or from 5% to 10%. So with those tailwinds there, maybe just smile if you agree.Well, look I want to drive this business as hard as we possibly can. We've got a great, great product roadmap to do it.Perfect! So letâ€™s talk about the competition side of things. How does pricing enter this equation? Unfortunately I'm old enough to remember the last time when AMD did hit that kind of upper 20â€™s market share and the response at that point from your primary competitor\n",

I think AMD deserves a huge congratulations of hitting up to the 10% or double digit market share in the June quarter that you guys had promised. I know you're not going to give whatever the new market share target is.

There's a thousand things that are different this time, but how do you think pricing enters this equation and are you seeing any change in the behavior on that front?Look, you know I think we've always anticipated, you know there's a lot of scar tissue here at AMD, you know competing with Intel for many years and theyâ€™re a fantastic company, a great competitor.

And then secondly, regardless of what happens in the market, we got to gain share, and I think we've got the product and the roadmap to do it.So when you talk about that share gain dynamics, I want to dive into some of the technology side of that equation and what's driven that? Obviously there's a huge attribution given to the manufacturing node, not only your success\n",

So the Zen CPU Core Roadmap is absolutely critical and that when we introduced it in 2017, you know it was over a 50% improvement and instructions per clock cycle from our, the predecessor product.

For 2020, we continue to expect EBITDA of around â‚¬520 million. As in our last outlook, the figure does not take into account one-time restructuring expenses which could result in up to â‚¬40 million. Including this one-off effect, we would see an EBITDA of â‚¬480 million. Due to the high-cost discipline and the optimized use of our logistics network. EBITDA of the Americas operating unit is now expected to be only slightly lower than in the previous year,\n",

Turning to Slide 7 to reiterate, we are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal 2020, and we're more at peak now about the company's future when we were at the end of the first quarter. We expect revenue to be in the range of $270 million to $290 million. Gross margin of 11% to 13% of revenue, and SG&A to be between 8% to 8.5% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA forecast to be $13 million to $15 million, and we currently expect to achieve adjusted EBITDA at the higher end of this range. The company has already generated $6.6 million of adjusted EBITDA thus far in 2020, with our lightest quarter being completed in Q1. We continue to actively pursue additional work, build our backlog and diversify the business while maintaining strict discipline over costs\n",

      " The transcript from the 2020 Deutsche Bank Technology Conference features a discussion between Ross Seymore, a Semiconductor Analyst at Deutsche Bank, and Forrest Norrod, SVP and GM of the Datacenter and Embedded Business Solutions Group at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Key points from the conversation are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "### General Business Overview\n",
      "- **Semi-Custom Business**: Forrest commented that AMD has a strong ramp in the second half of 2020 across multiple product lines, with demand remaining strong and the ramp going as expected, though he couldn't provide specifics about any particular product or customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Impact of COVID-19\n",
      "- **Productivity**: Despite initial concerns, productivity has either remained stable or increased. Engineers and teams have adapted to remote work, maintaining project timelines and product launches.\n",
      "- **Demand**: The pandemic has accelerated IT transformation, driving increased demand for infrastructure both in the cloud and on-premise to support remote work.\n",
      "\n",
      "### U.S.-China Trade Tensions\n",
      "- **Compliance**: AMD is fully committed to complying with U.S. regulations and has secured necessary licenses to manage interactions with entities on the restricted list. While the situation is evolving, AMD does not expect a significant impact on its business.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cloud Computing Market\n",
      "- **Demand**: Cloud demand has been strong, particularly in Q2, driven by the need for additional infrastructure for collaboration and remote work. AMD remains focused on gaining market share and executing on projects already won.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Server CPU Market Share\n",
      "- **Market Share**: AMD achieved double-digit market share in the June quarter, a significant milestone. While specific future targets aren't disclosed, the company aspires to exceed its historical high of around 26-27% unit share over time.\n",
      "- **Customer Base**: The initial 5% market share was primarily cloud-driven, but with the launch of Rome, the customer base has expanded to include more enterprise workloads. Milan, the next-generation product, aims to cover virtually all workloads, from enterprise to cloud, and is expected to drive further share gains.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Manufacturing and Technology\n",
      "- **7 Nanometer Node**: AMD has successfully ramped up 7 nanometer production, which has been critical for performance and cost efficiency. The company remains focused on maintaining its manufacturing lead and ensuring sufficient supply to meet demand.\n",
      "- **Chiplet Technology**: The use of chiplet technology has been pivotal in optimizing performance and yield, allowing AMD to access advanced technology nodes more efficiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Competitive Landscape\n",
      "- **Pricing**: AMD anticipates a highly competitive environment but focuses on delivering superior performance to win on total cost of ownership (TCO) at the system level.\n",
      "- **ARM-Based CPUs**: While there has been interest in ARM in the server market, AMD remains focused on high-performance x86 solutions. Migrating workloads from x86 to ARM is a significant barrier, and AMD believes its strong performance roadmap will ensure competitiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "### GPU Market\n",
      "- **Aspirations**: AMD sees GPUs as a critical driver of growth in the datacenter, with key areas including VDI (Remote Rendering), traditional HPC, and machine learning. The company is focused on open-source software frameworks and improving developer ease of use to drive adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "- **Future Outlook**: AMD is confident in its ability to continue growing its datacenter business, driven by a strong product roadmap, expanding customer base, and focus on delivering superior performance and TCO.\n",
      "\n",
      "This summary highlights the key points discussed, emphasizing AMD's strategic focus, market performance, and future outlook.\n",

      " Answer:\n",
      "Based on the provided context, the main points from the AMD earnings call transcript include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Supply Chain Confidence:** The company is confident in its supply chain from wafers to substrates, ensuring they can meet their production goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Server CPU Market Share:** AMD has achieved double-digit market share in the Server CPU market, hitting around 10% in the June quarter. This achievement is a significant milestone, with the company expected to continue its growth trajectory.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Product Performance and Customer Trust:** The second-generation EPYC processors, known as Rome, have been crucial in building customer trust and confidence. These processors offer double the performance of competitors' offerings and demonstrate AMD's ability to deliver on its promises.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Strategic Execution:** The company emphasizes the importance of predictable execution, which has given customers confidence to invest in AMD's infrastructure and optimize for its micro-architecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Future Roadmap:** The third-generation EPYC processors, known as Milan, are set to further build on the success of Rome, reinforcing AMD's commitment to its roadmap and continued performance improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Semi-Custom Business:** While the company cannot comment on specific products or customers, demand for its semi-custom business remains strong, and the ramp-up is on track.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Impact of COVID-19:** The pandemic has had both positive and negative impacts. Work-from-home and cloud demand have been positive factors, while new workloads have faced some delays due to uncertainty.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **GPU Market Aspirations:** AMD sees GPUs as a critical driver of growth in the datacenter market and is focused on delivering high-quality products to address this market effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Competition and Pricing:** The company is prepared to compete aggressively in the market, with a focus on maintaining strong performance and value propositions. Pricing strategies are considered but are not the only factor in market success.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Future Outlook:** AMD is optimistic about its future, driven by a strong product roadmap and continued execution. The company aims to drive market share gains as hard as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "These points highlight AMD's strategic focus on execution, product performance, and market positioning as key drivers of its success and future growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer is based on the context:\n",
      "1. and I think weâ€™ve commented, supply is sufficient, but â€“ you know but it's tied, the places of premium on planning for ourselves as well as planning for our consumers, but we think we've got the supply chain, lined up from wafers to substrates and you know everything in between to hit our goods [ph].So let's pivot over to the Server CPU market specifically and some of the market share side of things. I think AMD deserves a huge congratulations of hitting up to the 10% or double digit market share in the June quarter that you guys had promised. I know you're not going to give whatever the new market share target is. I think at the last event that I actually physically attended within the industry was your analyst meeting back in early March and no such number was given at that time.\n",

The company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements that may be discussed during this call. Lastly, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures on today's call. On Pages 5 and 6 of today's earnings release, we provide consolidated statements of operations and a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income. In addition, on Page 8 of the\n",

It was getting to having people used to AMD back into the market, was having customers believe that we could deliver a high performance, a component, whether we were doing what we set, and to that end Rome was hugely important, the second generation EPYC processors that we introduced last August, it was hugely important. Not just because it's a great product and you know really the 64 cores offers literally double the performance of our principal competitors offerings at that point in time, so just about the same.  Not only offering literally double the performance, the other critical part of Rome is it's exactly what we said we were going to do, and that predictability of execution gives customers confidence that they can invest in putting AMD into their\n",
      "\n",
      "4. and speculation that about your semi-custom business and while I realize that's not exactly the topic of the day that we're going to be addressing here, I wondered if you could comment a little bit about those reports?Well look, you know as we've commented before, we have a very large ramp coming into the second half of the year, across multiple product lines, really across every business. And you know I can't really comment on any specific product or any specific customer, but demand continues to be extremely strong and the ramp is going about as we expected.Great! Thanks for addressing that in general. So why donâ€™t we dive a little bit deeper into your business. So the Datacenter market and the Server CPU market specifically, those have been great growth drivers for AMD over the last\n",

You know I think that going back you have to look at the resurgence of AMD as the fruits, you know from the seeds that were planted back in really quite frankly 2012, when Mark Papermaster and Lisa Su came in, one of the first things they did in 2012 before Lisa was even CEO, was kick off the generation of the new high performance CPU core engines.  So the Zen CPU Core Roadmap is absolutely critical and that when we introduced it in 2017, you know it was over a 50% improvement and instructions per clock cycle from our, the predecessor product. And so that has nothing to do with the process. That's entirely the architecture and the implementation of the design, independent of clock speed and independent of process.  And so I think you\n",

Adjusted EBITDA also increased year-over-year to $5.5 million in Quarter 2 from $4 million in 2019 a 25% improvement. Our backlog rose to $539 million during the quarter, reflecting $111 million of new awards, most of which relates to fuel storage and decommissioning.

If you take a look at the EBITDA after leases, this one grows including Sprint by 56%. Organically, you see there is a strong 8.4%, after the 9%, which we showed last quarter.

Sales rose slightly year-over-year reflecting continued work on the Vogtle sites as well as $7 billion of additional decommissioning work and $5 million of higher revenue from Canada. Those gains were largely offset by the timing of a scheduled outage with one of our utility customers. We continue to forecast that our Vogtle work will run at a rate of roughly $25 million to $30 million per quarter this year, although itâ€™s nearly $32 million this period and about the same in Q1.

Mr. Victor Li, please go ahead.Thank you very much, Joyce. Hello, everyone. Before diving into our results for the first half of 2020, I would like to just reiterate how excited and honored I am to be taking the helm here at Pintec. As many of you know, Mr. Wei Wei is unfortunately experiencing some prolonged health complications. And he is no longer capable of taking responsibility of the daily operations of a publicly traded company. We're all very grateful for Mr. Wei's past contributions, and wish him a speedy recovery.  Now, turning to our results for the first half of 2020. Pintec encountered a series of challenges in 2019 and the first half of 2020, including changes in market conditions, regulation, external partners and management. We also faced outbreak of COVID-19, which significantly impacted our operations in the first half of 2020. In response to these challenges, we decided to shift our business focus by providing an increasing number of digital-centric services, while also gradually reducing our risk-sharing services. As a result of long-term orientation, our top-line performance was adversely impacted in the first half of 2020, with total revenues and cost of revenues decreasing by 65% and 51% year-over-year respectively.  The decision to adopt the new growth strategies was made after careful consideration of the current market conditions and our unique competitive advantages. As part of the strategic pivot, we have now divided our services into digital technical services and digital operation services, which include our licensed financial services. Over the long-term, we plan to augment the revenue and profitability of our digital technical services, and stabilize our digital operation services by refining our asset quality and thus reducing the associated risks.   To further enhance our daily operations, we are also focused on optimizing our product matrix, employee structure, and costs and expenses. We remain confident that such\n",

Doug, the call is yours.Thank you, Jeff, and good morning everyone. Despite the significant challenges presented by the COVID-19 situation, our second quarter results with much stronger June net sales in April and May provide continued evidence that we remain boldly back on track. In June, we generated $10 million of our $14.8 million quarterly sales. With July's net sales exceeding June, we see a continued strengthening in our customer demand. While we ramped up production from the very low April and May levels, we're effectively able to maintain overall operational and SG&A cost discipline. In the second quarter, our SG&A costs, including an $0.3 million severance charge, were $6.3 million compared to $5.9 million in the first quarter, and $7.4 million in the second quarter of 2019.  Despite the significant challenges over the last month, our operational and commercial improvements will continue to move the business positively forward. We have rebuilt the earnings power of Unique Fabricating, and as the automotive industry rebounds, we are well-positioned for continued success.

I think that you know we see a lot of tire kicking, weâ€™ve seen it for a decade and you know different companies make their own independent decisions.  Our focus is make sure that we are always providing, you know extremely high performance and most competitive performance CPU cores and increasingly GPU and the combination together and I think that so long as we're doing that, we've got a great competitive environment ahead of us and we expect to see x86 is still the dominant Instruction Set Architecture in core.So we only have a couple of minutes left, so I want to hit on a topic you just mentioned, about the partnership between the CPU and the GPU. Obviously GPUs accelerators have been a huge market. Your biggest competitor on that side has grown that market from a couple of hundred million dollars to multiple billions of dollars per year in business. Talk about AMD's aspirations in that market and when do you think that can be a needle mover within your company as a whole?Yeah, no I think we definitely see GPUs as a critical driver of growth in the datacenter, you know for us going forward and weâ€™ve thought that way for a while. Weâ€™ve just tried to be very thoughtful about, weâ€™re â€“ you know any company has to make resource decisions and Iâ€™d much rather do a great job at a few things than a crappy job at one thing too many. But that said, I think weâ€™ve been very thoughtful in preparing for GPUs being a bigger part of our data center portfolio for some time.  When we think about GPUs in the datacenter, we really think about it in three different primary areas. One is essentially VDI or you know Remote Rendering; rendering in the datacenter, be it for cloud gaming or be it for a desktop, workstation, a replacement.  We think that's an important growth area for us. We are pleased and proud to be part of several major cloud gaming initiatives. We are pleased and proud to be part of some great cloud VDI offerings as well on the productivity side, and given COVID, we expect to see quite a bit more of that or not just COVID, COVID and its after effective you know what effort people refer to as the next normal of increased work-from-home no matter what. We expect to see that VDI interest and market continue to grow.  The second piece is really traditionally HPC, traditional High Performance Computing for scientific research, medical research, you know for product design and then lastly of course, and certainly far from last in terms of importance, you know machine intelligence, artificial intelligence, machine learning. We see all three of those as being critical growth drivers for us going forward.  With all of them, the software is the key aspect and so we focus on a couple of things. First off, there is no point in trying to duplicate what my competitor has done. You know trying to run and catch up, running their exact same play is a foolâ€™s error. And so what weâ€™ve done is weâ€™ve really worked to partner with others on development of an open source software framework for â€“ or software frameworks for both machine intelligence and HPC and so we our rock [ph] have been stacked for example.You know radio and open compute is a critical part that allows our customers and us to innovate together and to drive some pretty compelling solutions.  The second piece of this is, you know accelerator for HPC or machine intelligence was still hard to use. And so part of it is you know continued to work on frameworks, continuing to make it easier for developers to embrace this technology, but the other key part that weâ€™ve talked about that's really led to our excess scale wins was adding coherency, so that the CPU and GPUs instead of being part connected by a thin IO link are connected via high performance coherent interconnect, where very\n",

In closing, I wanted to highlight that while our primary focus during these times is the health and safety of our employees and all stakeholders, we also feel a great sense of responsibility to continue delivering electricity under our long-term offtake agreements and concessions. Our efforts continue to focus on ensuring our facilities operate at the highest levels of availability, delivering the essential power that our offtake counterparties rely on and need. We've taken measures to enhance our financial flexibility and liquidity, as Pauline has outlined, to weather the current environment and to ensure that our business remains resilient. Lastly, by leveraging our financial flexibility, extensive development expertise and knowledge, we will continue to identify and develop future opportunities to further expand our global development footprint and enhance Northland's growth. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'd now be happy to take your questions. Tia, please open the line for any questions.[Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from Sean Steuart with TD Securities.A couple of questions to start with. First on the unpaid curtailment in Germany. I think the MD&A referenced 28 days for each facility potentially. Can you give us an idea of where we are in -- relative to that maximum for each facility and what we might expect to see in the third quarter with respect to the grid repairs, I suppose, specifically?Yes. So we'll get to the exact numbers in just 1 second, Sean. But with respect to Deutsche Bucht, which had a significant unscheduled outage in the second quarter, most of the unscheduled days have now been used up. So we don't anticipate any significant outage or unscheduled outage that would be uncompensated for the rest of the year. On Nordsee One, there are still almost a full allotment of unscheduled days available for the rest of the year. I would say one thing on both of those projects is that what we've seen in both respects is that early on with some of the new infrastructure from the transmitter, there have been some, what we've kind of characterized as, teething issues that have been worked out and we saw that with Nordsee One earlier, not long after that project was commissioned. And we've obviously seen a lengthy outage this quarter with Deutsche Bucht. So I mean no guarantee, Sean, but I think it is, in our view, certainly a nonrecurring event and then the nature of new infrastructure that once it begins operating, the transmitter sees what's wrong. We don't always get a ton of transparency or disclosure of exactly what went wrong from the transmitter, but certainly, our experience with Nordsee One is that early on, there's some issues, but then it tends to normalize.You mentioned for Hai Long 2B and 3, going down the path of securing commercial agreements to augment the capacity awards already. Can you just give us an idea of how that might look? How you marry those 2 together to come up with a full contract structure for those projects?Yes. So both of those projects, total 744 megawatts had to complete their permitting in order to execute their PPA with Taipower, the utility, right? And so that's the process under the auction that we bid into, and the PPAs would be at the price that we bid into that auction. We have both those projects now have met all the permitting requirements to sign the PPA. I think we've disclosed in an earlier call that we have held off on signing PPA because we've been told by Taipower that they're bringing out a new PPA, which will have some advantageous terms or some preferable terms in it, including, we believe, the ability to kind of step in and step out of that PPA and enter into commercial offtake agreements, but still use the Taipower PPA as a floor, if you will, right, or as\n",

We're one of the small number of companies that's been involved in the last two to three years construction projects and would anticipate continuing to be involved going forward, if small modular reactors comes to fruition.Thank you. And quick question for Randy, are you seeing any activity on the M&A front?M&A activity generally is down as far as Williams is concerned. I think that's not something we're seeing on that, the immediate horizon.Okay, thanks very much.Thank you.Our next question comes from Dick Ryan with [indiscernible]. Please proceed with your question.Hi, Dick.Hey, good morning, guys. Congratulations on some good performance. Tracy, if I recall, you had a $60 million win for decommissioning right after Q1. Obviously, that would be in the $111 million for bookings. But, can you talk about the rest -- kind of give us some color of the rest of the wins during the quarter where they a couple specific projects or what was that profile like and how does the margins look in the new business that you're booking.We continued them not only when work with Holtec, but the Holtec SNC partnership, which is known as CDI which actually does the more of the direct decommissioning work, we continue to get wins there. The margins are consistent with our nuclear business in decommissioning. So they're somewhere in the range of 5% to 10% depending on the project and as the work evolves. We also had some wins with other customers TBA but the substantial portion of it for this quarter anyway was with the decommissioning fuel storage business.Okay. Okay. And the planned outage that occurred last year will that -- is that on tap to occur again?Yes.In the second quarter next year?Yes. We're already working on the planning for it.Order of magnitude, can you give us a sense what that might --Itâ€™s typically, it's typically $20 million to $25 million in that range can be more or less, but that's a pretty good ballpark.Okay. Okay. And you always have -- looks like puts and takes adjustments in the backlog $30 some million this quarter down year-over-year, but is there anything to read in that anything out of the norm?No, I mean, typically our backlog goes forward. And that's one of the -- many low risk elements of our business platform is that our backlog is fairly certain. Some of it this year, I think we've seen a little bit more in terms of project delays just because of COVID-19. Although -- again, we feel like we're going to pick that work back up. Randy, do you have anything else to add there?No, I think I don't think it's anything out of the norm. But I think there is some COVID impact in terms of delayed awards in some cases, but that work is picking back up again.Okay. And it sounds like your kind of industrial business in Florida is comeback?Our industrial business in Florida is extremely strong right now Matt Petrizzo is our President of our Energy and Industrial business and responsible for that water business? Matt, do you have anything that you want to add on that?No, I think you -- I think you said it correct. We're very, very happy with the work that's been done in Florida. We've added some new customers, we've right sized our cost structure, and we feel really good about the direction that we're headed in, in that in that area.And the activity is definitely picked up in the second and third quarters. And our win rate is picking up. And Matt's done a very good job when Matt took that business over in early â€˜19, we had one customer JEA and we were not the top contractor and so now for JEA we're probably the top contractor in terms of that work.Great to hear.

      "7. Welcome to Teekay Corporation's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call. During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now, for the opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Company. Please go ahead.Before we begin, I'd like to direct all participants to our website at www.teekay.com, where you'll find a copy of the second quarter of 2020 earnings presentation. Kenneth And Vince will review this presentation during today's conference call. Please allow me to remind you that our discussion today contains forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from results projected by those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the second quarter 2020 earnings release and earnings presentation available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Kenneth to begin.Thank you, Ryan. Hello, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us today for Teekay Corporation's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. I hope that you and your families are all safe and healthy. On the call today, I'm joined by Vince Lok, Teekay's group CFO. Before we get into our results, I'd again like to take a moment to thank all of our seafarers and shore-based staff for their continued and extraordinary dedication to maintain business continuity. The unprecedented impact of COVID-19 continues to be a major area of focus for us, but we have thus far successfully navigated the evolving logistical and regulatory challenges, with minimal impact on our operations. We're truly proud and thankful of how our seafarers and on-shore colleagues have responded to COVID-19, implementing new standards to ensure the continued health and well-being of everyone involved in our organization, especially our colleagues at sea, while maintaining consistently safe and efficient operations for our customers. Moving to our recent highlights on Slide 3 of the presentation. In the second quarter of 2020, we reported our third consecutive quarterly adjusted profit, recording consolidated adjusted net income of $40 million or $0.39 per share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $13 million or $0.13 per share in the same period of the prior year. We also generated a total adjusted EBITDA of $316 million, an increase of $119 million, or 61%, from the same period of last year. Our strong results in the second quarter can be attributed to solid earnings in each of our main businesses. Teekay LNG reported another quarterly record high in adjusted net income and total adjusted EBITDA. Teekay Tankers experienced another quarter of strong spot tanker rates, and our directly owned FPSO operating results improved as a result of the new bareboat charter contract secured in late March on the Foinaven FPSO, which eliminated our exposure to the previous lossmaking contract. Looking ahead to next quarter, we expect Teekay LNG will continue Earning stable cash flows, as a result of its LNG fleet being fully fixed through the rest of 2020. At Teekay Tankers, the spot tanker market has come under pressure since mid-May, following three quarters of strong spot tanker rates. The near-term outlook for the tanker market is uncertain at this point, and to some degree, linked to the global oil production and demand, which presently is about 10% lower than the average demand in 2019. In our tanker business, we continue to follow the prudent path that we laid out at our Investor Day last November, and we're pleased to have significantly reduced our effective free cash flow breakevens and near-term spot exposure by locking in 23% of the tanker fleet on fixed rate contracts at attractive rates, and we are encouraged by fleet supply\n",
      "\n",
      "8. to last year's results. So the key question is now going to be what's going to happen in the third quarter and what's going to happen in the fourth quarter. Obviously, we have only limited visibility. But for the time being what we're assuming is that we're basically staying in line with that impact which we have shown you in Q1. That is also one of the reasons why we're basically reiterating the guidance both on EBITDA and free cash flow for the business ex U.S. Let me move over to the segment performance and start as usual with Germany. And let's move over to Page 13. What you can see is basically overall revenues grew by 1.1% and the EBITDA growth sees a â€“ or saw a slight acceleration to 3%. But â€“ and that's actually well above our full year target. So from this perspective very, very nice. The total service revenue growth accelerated to 1.6% year-over-year. This is very much driven by the fixed line performance which we have seen in the second quarter. Moving to the next page 14. Mobile service revenue declined by 1.1%. That obviously includes all the roaming effects. If we would exclude the roaming effect and the visitor effect we would be close to 2%, which would be in line with our midterm guidance on the service revenue. Also if you compare the performance in previous year with this year obviously, we had to fight against a strong quarter in the second quarter last year. And therefore, we expect that we're going to see a slight improvement in the second half when it comes to the mobile service revenue. And again as I said, the guidance which we gave at the Capital Markets Day of 2% remains intact. Fixed line revenues were up almost 3% year-over-year, very much driven by the strength of the broadband revenue growth but also wholesale showed a very strong result. We talked about the tailwind effects of the out-of-bundle calls. If you basically carve those effects out, they would qualify for 1.3 percentage points of this 2.9%. And you see that this is really significant what we're seeing here. So we expect this out-of-bundle revenue to stay there but also what we're seeing is that the momentum is coming slightly down. So it's not like it's comparable for example with the March or the April numbers which we have seen. We're moving to Page 15. You see that the commercial performance remains pretty intact. So we continue to see significant growth in MagentaOne. We have registered about 110,000 branded contract net adds. I would say that's an almost normal intake, slightly below that. The B2C churn remains on a low level at 0.8%. And also we're seeing a significant increase in mobile data usage with our contract customers and that 50% obviously supports our More for More strategy. We have now 3.5 million customers on StreamOn. That is an increase of 400,000 customers, since the beginning of the year. Moving on with the next chart, on page 16. I think you may recall, I was complaining about the broadband performance in Q2 of last year and said okay, we have to improve from here. This year, I have to reverse that assessment and I have to applaud for the performance of that 87,000. That is three times the numbers we have seen from the guys in this regard. And it's also the second consecutive quarter, where we're really well above the 40% net adds share at least according to our analysis. And I think this is a very, very strong result. Also, if you're taking a look at the line losses with negative 62,000 that is pretty much one-third of the previous year's line losses. And I think, we'll look back into those and we couldn't find a lower number since 2004 and we had to stop at 2004 because we didn't have any further documentation of the previous years.  On the fiber connection, we added about 400,000 fiber connections this quarter. So, that is comparable with last quarter. The TV performance is okay-ish, but it's really also impacted by the shop closures and the limitations you have once you enter a shop. So from this\n",

Net loss in the first half of 2020 was RMB104.2 million compared to a net income of RMB81.2 million in the same period of 2019. Adjusted net loss in the first half of 2020 was RMB96.9 million compared to adjusted net income of RMB111.1 million in the same period of 2019. Diluted GAAP and diluted non-GAAP adjusted net loss for ordinary shares in the first half of 2019 were both RMB0.33 respectively.  Now, let's turn to our balance sheet. As of June 30, 2020, we had combined cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash of RMB588.5 million compared to RMB580.9 million as of December 31, 2019. Total net financing receivables, including short-term and long-term receivables, was RMB75.9 million as of June 30, 2020 from RMB449.5 million as of December 31, 2019. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus ramping up revenues in our digital technical services business segment, which we expect to become a key revenue contributor in the long-term. We understand that these adjustments will impact our top-line for the short-term, however, we are confident that these changes will bring solid foundation and sustainable development to the company. At the same time, we will also work towards refining our asset quality for digital operation services as well as our licensed financial services in order to reduce the associated risk. We will accomplish this by increasing our activity of quality financial institutions, capable of bearing risk and decreasing our activity with those partners who require after share risk. As such, notwithstanding the impact from the unanticipated COVID-19 outbreak, we expect our efforts to contribute to a recovery to our financial performance and position in the near term. This concludes our prepared remarks for today. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Daphne Poon from Citi. Please ask your question.So I have two questions. First one is, can you talk more about how do you differentiate -- in terms of your technical service, how do you differentiate compared to those traditional IT service providers and also compared to the Internet giants who are also doing that IT service, technical service for their banks? And the second question is, can you talk more about your progress in terms of international expansion?Okay. I'll take the question. Firstly, thanks for paying attention to our newly defined strategy. Pintec as a leading technology company in digitization for banking and financial institutions, our hands-on experience in supporting business growth through product innovation and digital operation has given us a very unique value proposition comparing to traditional IT service providers in the same domain. This is owing to our direct involvement, either through our partnership with financial and commercial partners or through our own licensed financial services over the last few years. As we all know, digitization is not just about technology, and it requires true expertise in the business domain and operational excellence in order to drive revenue growth and improve operational efficiency. Therefore, Pintec's ability to innovate, our extensive experience in product development and the cooperation with financial institutions, and plus our technical solutions and services in big data, AI and process automation, allow us to add value to our partners from day one of collaboration. So we are very confident to the future of our digital technical services.  To answer your second question, in the global landscape, China's fintech industry has been quite advanced, especially in the last 10 years. We are very optimistic that our experiences gained in this fast-growing market will make us stay competitive in the global market. Apart from assisting some global clients expanding their business in China, we have also set up joint innovation center with East West\n",

With us on the line today are Magicâ€™s CEO, Mr. Guy Bernstein; Magicâ€™s CFO, Mr. Asaf Berenstin; and Magicâ€™s VP of Technology and Innovation, Mr. Yuval Lavi. Magicâ€™s quarterly earnings releases release was issued before the market opened this morning, and it has been posted on the company's Web site at www.magicsoftware.com. Before we start, I'd like to remind everyone that this conference call may contain projections or other forward looking statements. The Safe Harbor provision provided in the press release issued today also applies to the content of this call. Magic expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any of these forward looking statements, whether because of future events, new information, a change in its views or expectations or otherwise. Also during the course of today, management will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation schedule showing GAAP versus non-GAAP results has been provided in the press release issued before the market opened this morning. A replay of this call will be available after the call on our Investor Relations section of the company Web site. I will now like to turn the call over to Mr. Asaf Berenstin, CFO of Magic Software. Please go ahead.Thank you, Joni, and thank you, everyone for joining us today as we report our second quarter 2020 financial results. Our second quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver our software solutions and services for existing customers and closing new deals alongside our continued solid execution of our priorities of top line growth despite the continued global impact of the COVID-19 business disruption. Revenues grew by 12% year-over-year to $86.5 million in the quarter, with sales mainly coming from expansions of our business in North America and in Israel. Overall, COVID-19 had only small impact over our first and second quarter results as we prioritized performance, while adjusting our approach to operation. We continue to work closely with our large customer base, supporting them in their transition to the new working format and addressing the challenges they face. As market continue to adapt to the new normal, we see that the current business disruption related to the pandemic increased the sense of urgency for enterprises to migrate their legacy platform to enhance their competitive advantage by offering more digital solutions, while improving their operations efficiency. This alone is driving future opportunities for Magic Software as our business is benefiting from these global trends that are driving our growth. This includes most and foremost, the demand for the wide range of top technologies, methodologies, and services of the SMB digital transformation demand for services as organizations continue to migrate from legacy systems to modern, flexible on premise or cloud based solutions, as well as the need for meeting customer's expectations for digital and more personalized experience. Today, most of our deliverables to our existing customers continue as planned and we did not see a significant impact on our revenue streams from existing customers. Although, some prospects are taking longer to close as enterprises put new agreements on hold until there is less uncertainty from COVID-19. From Magic's point of view, our direct customer relations, as well as our trusted advisor approach, has been a beneficial aspect of our business model, especially in this challenging business environment as we help customers address the new and unique challenges to COVID-19. In return, this helps us secure our repeating revenues while increasing sales with our existing customer base, delivering additional services to enable our\n",

      "1. Good morning and good evening everyone. Thank you for standing by and welcome to Pintec Technology Holdings Limited's First Half 2020 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Now, I'll turn the call over to your speaker host today, Ms. Joyce Tang, the company's Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead.Hello, everyone, and welcome to Pintec's first half 2020 earnings conference call. The company's financial and operational results were issued earlier today and are posted online. You can also view the earnings press release by visiting the IR website at ir.pintec.com. A replay of the call will be available on the IR website in a few hours.

Pintec's press release contains a recalculation of the unaudited non-GAAP measures to the unaudited most directly comparable GAAP measures. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Mr. Victor Li. Mr. Victor Li, please go ahead.Thank you very much, Joyce. Hello, everyone. Before diving into our results for the first half of 2020, I would like to just reiterate how excited and honored I am to be taking the helm here at Pintec. As many of you know, Mr. Wei Wei is unfortunately experiencing some prolonged health complications. And he is no longer capable of taking responsibility of the daily operations of a publicly traded company. We're all very grateful for Mr. Wei's past contributions, and wish him a speedy recovery.  Now, turning to our results for the first half of 2020. Pintec encountered a series of challenges in 2019 and the first half of 2020, including changes in market conditions, regulation, external partners and management. We also faced outbreak of COVID-19, which significantly impacted our operations in the first half of 2020. In response to these challenges, we decided to shift our business focus by providing an increasing number of digital-centric services, while also gradually reducing our risk-sharing services. As a result of long-term orientation, our top-line performance was adversely impacted in the first half of 2020, with total revenues and cost of revenues decreasing by 65% and 51% year-over-year respectively.  The decision to adopt the new growth strategies was made after careful consideration of the current market conditions and our unique competitive advantages. As part of the strategic pivot, we have now divided our services into digital technical services and digital operation services, which include our licensed financial services. Over the long-term, we plan to augment the revenue and profitability of our digital technical services, and stabilize our digital operation services by refining our asset quality and thus reducing the associated risks.   To further enhance our daily operations, we are also focused on optimizing our product matrix, employee structure, and costs and expenses. We remain confident that such measures will help to improve our profitability on a gradual basis going forward, despite the near-term headwinds.  For the remainder of my prepared remarks, I would like to provide everyone with some additional details and updates regarding both our digital technical services and digital operation services. Starting with the former. For digital technical services, we are focused on gradually ramping up our revenue while also refining our organizational structure, marketing strategies and product matrix. This business segment already include a number of state-of-art solutions in certain areas as digital retail credit management, corporate credit process management, intelligent wealth management, financial robotic process automation, and digital transformation for banks.  For digital technical services, in the first half of 2020, we established a more segmented team structure, with sales, pre-sales support and delivery teams. We have also adjusted our overall team size to accelerate our business development efforts, focused on controlling expenses and optimize our compensation system to better connect with employee performance.  On the marketing front, we continue to utilize our experiences in big data, AI, process automation, financial services, and application innovation to combine our SaaS system services with our software development services. We are also leveraging these core competencies to establish a variety of partnerships in the form of innovation centers, joint ventures, and more.  Following our detailed review of our existing product offerings, we have decided to allocate our resources to those products with higher profit margins on favorable market prospects, while reducing our investment into those products with lower profit margins. As a result of these efforts, our digital technical services entered into a period of rapid development during the first half of 2020, and we remain quite optimistic about the growth potential going forward. In fact, many of our partnerships and initiatives continued to make good progress in the first half of 2020. For example, our Australian subsidiary InfraRisk was successful in leveraging our digital retail credit management solutions to launch a new digital credit service with our Australian partners. Similar to the impact of Afterpayâ€™s Buy Now, Pay Later model and installment credit consumption markets, we expect this product to increase [loan services] [ph] access to personal credit solutions going forward.  We also continue to make good progress implementing our corporate lending process management solutions. During the period, InfraRisk utilized our well-recognized automated credit process management tool, namely, CVX to help Judo Bank upgrade its credit process management. We also continue to work hand-in-hand with Toyota Finance to support its financial services business throughout Europe, Oceania and Africa. We are now in the process of introducing our CVX system into the domestic markets and are already providing China Dili Group with CVX-based supply chain financing solutions. We have also been able to capitalize on the growing popularity of RPA solutions in the fintech industry by working with a company producing the world leading RPA products and helping such renowned clients, such as the Hong-Kong Stock Exchange to implement these solutions. We are focused on bringing these solutions to more financial institutions in the domestic market and continue to make good progress on this front as well. Finally, we are leveraging our expertise in digital financial products, Internet customer services, and channel development to help accelerate the digitization of financial institutions. As we have already provided East West Bank with our services in digital product development, process transformation and channel expansion, we are also actively discussing potential collaborations with a number of other overseas financial institution partners. In cities such as Shenzhen and Hong Kong, we have established various forms of joint innovation centers aimed at helping to facilitate our clientsâ€™ implementation of technical service projects across a variety of industries, including finance, entertainment, and automobile.  Turning to digital operation services. As a result of the current business environment in China, those companies participating in credit project cooperation will generally take responsibility for a portion of the risk. Owing to our early recognition of this trend, we decided to write-down a significant portion of our risk-sharing business and [tighten] [ph] our revenue generation capabilities. Despite creating a certain amount of uncertainty for our revenues in the short-term, this decision will help to refocus and strengthen our core business in the long-term, as well as improve the health of our revenue composition going forward. Our current goal within this business is to prioritize asset quality over asset quantity, reduce risk taking collaboration, enhance profit sharing model, partner with more industry leaders, and expand the market to technical services. Our digital operation services segment currently includes credit asset cooperation with financial institutions, value-added service cooperation with commercial institutions, financial services promotion, traffic diversion, credit decision support and more. In response to the challenges caused by the epidemic, we significantly decreased our activity with loans funding partners, who require us to share risks, and thus reduce our risk-sharing services in the first half of 2020. During the period, our total volume of loans facilitated decreased by 83% year-over-year to RMB1.2 billion. In addition, as of June 30, 2020, our outstanding loan balance had decreased by 61% year-over-year, to RMB1.3 billion. We also continue to optimize our product matrix by focusing on our developments of high quality products, with use case scenarios for such renowned business platforms as Ctrip and BestPay. In fact, as of June 30, 2020, our cooperative product with Ctrip, Qunar and [indiscernible] accounted for approximately 39% of our outstanding loan balance and our cooperative product BestPay with China Telecom accounted for 38% of our outstanding loan balance. We believe that the optimization of our price structure has not only helped to boost the overall quality of our partnership base, but also further incentivize financial institutions to cooperate with us through profit-sharing partnership models.  In the first half of 2020, we continue to forge more partnerships with leading financial institutions, and thus maintained relationships with 11 cooperative funding partners in the period, including both self-owned micro finances as well as factoring partners. Additionally, during the period, the profile funding partners are all leading licensed financial institutions, which accounted for 94% of total funding amounts. We remain committed to attracting more top-tier funding partners and establishing more agreements through our profit-sharing model with partners. This is in line with our aim to complete our transition into a profit-sharing model of cooperation as soon as possible and significantly reduce our risk-sharing cooperation with existing funding partners. The performance of our loans and overdue loans gradually improved during the first half of 2020 as a result of these efforts, especially the M1+ delinquency was well decreased in 2020 Q2 from 2020 Q1 and even better than 2019 Q4. This consistent improvement was mainly due to: number one, abandoning products with poor asset quality and refocusing our efforts on to those products with use case scenarios; number two, abandoning the guarantee model, as we no longer provide any guarantee. Our funding partners have higher risk management requirements for each loan, thus reducing low-quality loans; number three, the successful interface of Ganzhou Aixin with the PBOC's credit reference center, which enabled us to utilize credit investigation to better manage risk, implement multi-dimensional risk control measures and augment Ganzhou Aixin's performance; and number four, leveraging our capabilities in technology, law and other areas, to help our funding partners improve their regulation compliance and post loan management efficiency.  In summary, our activity in the first half of 2020 was marked by transformation. In response to the rapid evolving industry dynamics and outbreak of COVID-19, we have refocused our efforts and actively deployed our digital technical services. In response to these services, both at home and abroad has been quite positive, and we are excited to continue empowering our partners with our best-in-class solutions going forward. As our digital technical services continue to build momentum, we'll also maintain our focus on reducing our credit balance for our risk-sharing services, and we expect this combination of efforts to gradually improve our profitability over the long-term. Despite the current market challenges, we remain steadfast in our belief that our significant competitive advantages in technological innovation and financial services will continue to fuel the resiliency of our business, allow us to continue executing our development strategies and set a stage for return to growth in the coming year. With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Steven Sim, to review our financial results in more detail.Thank you, Victor. Hello, everyone. Before starting, please note that all numbers stated in the following remarks are in RMB terms and all comparisons are on a year-on-year -- year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted.  Now turning over to our financial results for the first half of 2020. Total revenue in the first half of 2020 decreased by 65% year-over-year to RMB251.6 million. Revenue from technical services -- service fees in the first half of 2020 decreased by 66% to RMB212.1 million from RMB624 million in the same period of 2019. This is mainly due to the decrease in off-book loans facilitated during the period. During the period, our business was severely disrupted by the COVID-19 outbreak, which impacted our revenue generation capabilities to a significant degree. In addition, during the backdrop of the COVID-19 outbreak, we also took the conscious decision to minimize our risk-bearing loans. As such, risk-bearing loans contributed to 17% of our total loan balance as of June 30, 2020 and 40% of our total loan balance as of December 31, 2019. Consequently, revenues from risk-bearing loans for off-book loans accounted for 24% of our revenues from technical service fees in the first half of 2020 compared to 38% in the same period of 2019. Revenues from installment service fees in the first half of 2020 decreased by 57.5% to RMB34.8 million from RMB82 million in the same period of 2019. This decrease was mainly due to the reduction of on-book installment loan volume due to the COVID-19 outbreak and which was in line with our ongoing strategy to reduce our portfolio structure.  Revenues from wealth management service fees in the first half of 2020 decreased by 66% to RMB4.7 million from RMB13.7 million in the same period of 2019. The decrease was mainly as a result of our insurance brokerage business growing slower than we previously expected. During the period, we implemented a series of optimization initiatives to refine our insurance brokerage business model and remove a number of online channels that fail to meet our expected compliance criteria. As such, we expect our revenues from insurance brokerage business to start recovering in the fourth quarter of 2020.  Cost of revenues in the first half of 2020 decreased by 50.6% to RMB208.9 million from RMB422.8 million in the same period of 2019. This decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in service costs, charged by Jimu Group as our cooperation model with Jimu Group changed from a model where we provide -- where they provided credit enhancement for the borrowers to a model where we provide credit enhancements to the borrowers.  In addition, we also recorded a decrease in origination and servicing costs primarily due to reduced user acquisition costs as a result of decrease in loan volume facilitated. The reduction of cost of revenues in the first half of 2020 was partially offset by two factors. First, we recorded an increase in provision for credit loss of on-balance sheet loans due to the impact of COVID-19 and the resulting decline in asset quality and increase in M3+ delinquency rates by balance in the period. Secondly, we had higher costs on guarantee liabilities for off-balance sheet loans in the period. Cost on guarantees significantly increased due to the fact that most services using risk-sharing models started from May 2019, while loan quality has continuously deteriorated since the second half of 2019. Nevertheless, as a result of our commitment to gradually stop providing any guarantee in 2020, costs on guarantee in the second quarter of 2020 have decreased by more than 50% compared with the first quarter of 2020, as it continued to decline on a sequential basis from the second half of 2019. Delinquency rates have also improved significantly since the second quarter of 2020.  Going forward, as we focus on the SaaS-based digital technology services, we will continue to reduce our risk-bearing business. In fact, we only provide guarantees for our financial services, which we operate with our own licenses, while all other loans that we facilitate will gradually switch to a profit-sharing model without any guarantee services, limiting volatility in earnings and profitability going forward. Gross profit in the first half of 2020 decreased to RMB42.7 million from RMB296.9 million in the same period of 2019. Gross margin in the first half of 2020 was 17% compared to 41.3% in the same period of 2019. Total operating expenses in the first half of 2020 decreased by 36.1% to RMB142.7 million from RMB223.3 million in the same period of 2019. Starting from the beginning of 2020, we have continued to optimize and refine our organizational structure, marketing strategies and product matrix. Let's now review the breakdown of operating expenses in the first half of 2020. Sales and marketing expenses in the first half of 2020 decreased by 41.1% to RMB24.9 million from RMB42.2 million in the same period of 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in staff costs, promotional expenses and share-based compensation. Staff cost decreased due to the adjustments to the company's employee structure, promotional expenses decreased due to a reduction of online advertisement expenditure. Also, share-based compensation decreased due to most of the share-based compensation being amortized in the prior year. General and administrative expenses in the first half of 2020 decreased by 31.6% to RMB93 million from RMB136 million in the same period of 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the decreases in share-based compensation and overhead expenses. It was also partially due to the decrease in bad debt expenses as a result of decrease in both our loan balance and accounts receivable balance for technical service fees. Research and development expenses in the first half of 2020 decreased by 44.9% to RMB24.8 million from RMB45.1 million in the same period of 2019, primarily driven by our lower business volume. Operating loss in the first half of 2020 was RMB100 million compared to an operating income of RMB73.6 million in the same period of 2019. Net loss in the first half of 2020 was RMB104.2 million compared to a net income of RMB81.2 million in the same period of 2019. Adjusted net loss in the first half of 2020 was RMB96.9 million compared to adjusted net income of RMB111.1 million in the same period of 2019. Diluted GAAP and diluted non-GAAP adjusted net loss for ordinary shares in the first half of 2019 were both RMB0.33 respectively.  Now, let's\n",

      "2. Good morning. My name is Nicole, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the MSG Networks Fiscal 2020 Fourth Quarter and Year Ending Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to hand the conference call over to Ari Danes, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Thank you, operator.

In addition, on Page 8 of the earnings release, we provide a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andrea.Thank you, Ari. Good morning. We appreciate everyone joining us for today's call. In March, the COVID-19 pandemic suddenly challenged us to find new ways to serve our customers and our communities, while we continue to pursue our core financial and strategic objectives in an already rapidly evolving media landscape. Despite these challenges and changes, I'm proud to say that during fiscal 2020, we were able to achieve several key goals that strengthen our company now and for the future. They include delivering substantial free cash flow, securing important distribution, continuing to grow our non-ratings-based advertising revenue and enhancing our financial flexibility through a debt refinancing. Throughout the pandemic, we've been extremely proud of our colleagues who have exemplified our strong culture and sense of purpose, as they seamlessly transition to working from home, ensuring we continue to deliver our program on all our platforms without interruption.  And with the return of live sports to our networks, some of us have even returned to our offices to bring viewers live telecast, along with studio commentary from our talented team. As an organization, we have become more nimble and discovered new efficiencies. We expect these learnings will ultimately make us a stronger company. Throughout this unprecedented time, we've seen the enduring popularity of live sports, which continues to reinforce the value of our exclusive live programming to our affiliates, partners and fans. This important content, along with our position in the New York DMA, helped drive our renewals with two major affiliates this past year and four of our top five affiliates during the last three fiscal years. Right now, we see the pent-up demand for live sports on full display as professional sports leagues have started to resume play. For our company, this has meant to return of live hockey and new original hockey programming. Two of our teams, the Rangers and the Islanders, headed to Toronto for the NHL Stanley Cup Qualifiers. An MSG Network covered their return with in-depth previews of both teams match up. We also did viewed new original hockey programming to capitalize on the excitement, including around the NHL, bringing fans the latest hockey news and information and MSG Hockey IQ and NHL-themed Trivia show, testing fan's knowledge of their teams. And once the games began, we were proud to service the exclusive broadcast term in our markets for the Islanders and Rangers. This included the team's exhibition match up as well as their qualifying rounds, which also featured comprehensive pre and post-game coverage. And our viewers can continue to follow the Islanders as they compete in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, which began this week. We also wrapped up the Ranger season with an exclusive one-on-one with President, John Davidson, who shared his excitement for next season following the team winning the draft lottery. And next week, we welcome the return of Major League Soccer, as the New York Red Bulls continue their season. Our goal during this time has been to remain focused on finding ways to create new content that is accretive to our bottom line and that keeps viewers connected to the teams they love. For example, during the Rangers and Islanders Stanley Cup Qualifiers, we introduced a number of unique activations, including virtual viewing parties that enabled us to integrate live footage of fans into our broadcast, tapping into the already strong sense of community among the loyal followers of our teams. We delivered an at-home version of MSG 150, which recently included interviews with Knicks' President Leon Rose; new Devils' Coach, Lindy Ruff; and Knicksâ€™ legend, Patrick Ewing; and introduced new Knicks' head coach, Tom Thibodeau, with a press conference and exclusive MSG Networks interview. We continue to leverage our extensive game library, creating opportunities for fans to not only relate to defining moments, but also gain new insights. For example, in May, as part of our programming block to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Knicks 1970 Championship, we held a special virtual roundtable discussion, hosted by Mike Breen that features Knicks' legend, Willis Reed, Walt Clyde Frazier and Bill Bradley as they reflected on their championship front. Turning to advertising. With the league suspension, we had fewer live game telecasts in fiscal 2020, which negatively impacted advertising revenue. However, we remain confident in our long-term prospects and continue to believe that we have meaningful advertising upside. Demand from advertisers for live sports remains robust, which was reflected in extremely strong sales for every one of our Rangers and Islanders Qualifying Game. This strong demand has continued into the Islanders first round Playoff series.  We also remain optimistic about the prospects for our non-ratings-based advertising initiatives. In fiscal 2019, we were able to double the size of our branded content business, which grew again in fiscal 2020 by a double-digit percentage. In addition, there's been strong ongoing demand from sponsors for MSG Go, our streaming app, which also saw a year-over-year double-digit percentage increase in revenue as well as robust utilization rates during the Rangers and Islanders returned to play game. As the only RSN to provide a live test module and interactive gaming on a platform, we are pleased with our ongoing improvements to the app, which are designed to increase customer engagements and enhance the value of the platform's sponsorship inventory. And we continue to see sports gaming as a unique long-term advertising and content opportunity, particularly should additional markets in our territory legalize mobile gaming. We experienced a high level of demand from our sports gaming partners during the Stanley Cup Qualifiers, including from leading brands like DraftKings and FanDuel, and we expect this momentum to continue. With regard to subscribers. As of May, MSG and MSG Plus had a combined average of approximately 6 million viewing subscribers, a year-over-year decrease of 8.9%. Our rate of subscriber decline has accelerated in recent quarters, a reflection of the changing media landscape. We also believe that our most recent monthly subscriber levels reflect COVID-19's impact on the economy. And while we expect these dynamics will continue with or not standing still, we remain focused on monetizing our existing library of content and our valuable media rights, including from new distribution opportunities. Finally, I would just point out that COVID-19 created several moving pieces across both revenues and operating expenses. The net impact of which was positive for adjusted operating income in the quarter. These results reflect a number of factors, including our analysis of our affiliate and rights agreements as well as the facts and circumstances as they exist today and our expectations for the 2020-2021 NBA and NHL seasons. As a reminder, at the time of the season suspensions, we were nearing the end of both weeks regular seasons. And we have since delivered additional game as part of the NHL's restart. We also currently expect a full slate of NBA and NHL games for the 2020-2021 season. And while these factors resulted in a net positive contribution to our fourth quarter AOI, going forward, it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact COVID-19 may have on our financial results, including with respect to subscribers, affiliate and advertising revenue and rights and other expenses. Throughout this period of uncertainty, we have been continually reminded of the strength of our employees, partners and communities and the important role that live sports plays in people's lives. I want to thank everyone, including our viewers and shareholders, for their continued support. I will now turn the call over to Bret, who will take you through our financial results.Thank you, Andrea. And good morning, everyone. Let's start by briefly discussing our full year fiscal 2020 financial results and then turn to results for our fourth quarter. For fiscal 2020, total revenues were $685.8 million, a decrease of approximately 5% as compared with the prior year. This decline was primarily driven by a decrease in affiliate revenue and, to a lesser extent, lower advertising revenue. Fiscal 2020 adjusted operating income was $321.4 million, which was approximately 4% lower as compared with the prior year. Our full year results were impacted by the decline in subscribers as well as by lower advertising revenue, which includes the impact of fewer live sports telecasts as a result of the suspension of the NBA and NHL 2019-2020 seasons. This was partially offset by lower direct operating expenses, also a result of the shortened NBA and NHL regular seasons.  Turning to results for the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter. Total revenues of $152.1 million decreased $16.2 million or approximately 10% as compared with the prior year period. This was driven by an $8.3 million decrease in affiliate revenue, primarily reflecting the impact of the decline in subscribers and to a lesser extent, the impact of a $2 million unfavorable net affiliate adjustment, partially offset by higher affiliate rates. The $2 million unfavorable net affiliate adjustment primarily reflects accrued affiliate rebates. Advertising revenue decreased $7.2 million year-over-year due to lower sales related to live professional sports telecasts, a lower net decrease in deferred revenue related to ratings guarantees and other net advertising decreases. The decrease in sales from live professional sports telecasts was primarily due to the absence of live NBA and NHL games in the quarter as compared to 16 regular season telecasts and three playoff telecasts during the prior year period. Direct operating expenses of $46.4 million decreased $23.7 million or 34% as compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower rights fees expense, a result of the impact of the shortened NBA and NHL regular seasons. SG&A expenses of $20.7 million decreased $5.7 million or 22% as compared with the prior year period. This was largely due to the absence of $3.6 million in expenses recorded in the prior year quarter that were not indicative of our core expense base, as well as a lower advertising and marketing costs and lower advertising sales commissions, partially offset by other net cost increases. Adjusted operating income of $90.5 million increased $14.1 million or 18% as compared with the prior year period, primarily due to the decrease in direct operating expenses and to a lesser extent, lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by the decrease in revenues. Reported free cash flow for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020 was approximately $207.2 million. Looking ahead to fiscal 2021. Assuming NBA and NHL play full 2020-2021 regular seasons, we would expect fiscal 2021 advertising revenue results to be positively impacted by the return to a normal level of professional sports telecasts. I would also note that the year-over-year comparability of quarterly advertising results in fiscal 2021 maybe impacted by a shift in the timing of the start of the 2021 regular seasons. In addition, advertising revenue in our seasonally quiet first quarter will benefit from the Rangers and Islanders returning to complete the 2019-2020 seasons. And as Andrea mentioned, we experienced robust demand for each team's return to play games. With respect to affiliate revenue, our current expectation is that over the next two quarters, in aggregate, we will have a similar affiliate revenue adjustment for potential affiliate rebates to what we recorded in the fiscal fourth quarter. On the expense side. While our fiscal 2021 first quarter results will reflect the modest residual impact of rights fees reductions, assuming the NBA and NHL play full 2021 regular seasons, we would expect to see higher rights fees expense and production losses on an annual basis versus fiscal 2020, as our business returns to a normalized expense run rate. Overall, our expectations are based on a variety of factors, which may change. Turning to our balance sheet. As of June 30, 2020, total cash and cash equivalents were approximately $196.8 million, while total debt outstanding was $1.09 billion and our $250 million revolver was undrawn. Our average interest rate for the quarter was approximately 2%. Net debt at quarter end decreased by approximately $65 million to $889 million, while our net leverage ratio decreased to 2.8 times trailing 12 months adjusted operating income. During the fiscal fourth quarter, we made a mandatory principal payment of $6.9 million in accordance with the terms of our credit agreement. For fiscal 2021, our credit facilities provide for $38.5 million in mandatory principal payments.  With regard to share buyback authorization, we have not repurchased shares since April 1 and currently have $146 million remaining. Going forward, we will continue to maintain a disciplined and opportunistic approach to capital allocation. I will now turn the call back over to Ari.Thank you, Bret. Can we open up the call for questions, please?[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of John Janedis with Wolfe Research.Hi. This is Se filling in for John. I had two questions. You renewed two deals last year, and there continues to be pressure on the bundle. Can you talk about the potential to be re-tiered? And whether you see this as a risk going forward?Adam, do you want to take that one?Sure. So â€“ yes, I mean, as you point out, we've successfully renewed two deals in the past fiscal year. We have a long track record of successfully renewing our affiliate agreements. We've successfully renewed four of our top five distributors over the past three fiscal years. We're comfortable with the terms of the renewals, including packaging and other protections. And we've indicated ensure continued expanded basic distribution for our networks. We think that our track record reflects the long-term mutually beneficial relationships we've built with our major affiliates and the importance and unique and well-established value of our content, particularly in this highly competitive New York DMA. Ultimately, we believe this is all going to continue to serve us well in future renewals, where we would expect to continue to see appropriate protections and fair value for our networks consistent with our history. I'd also point out that there have been some well-publicized recent renewals from other artisans around the country with major distributors, including new launches of new artisans where status quo packaging has been highlighted.Great, thanks. And I guess one more on the expense side. To what extent, are there permanent cost reductions that you've either executed on since the start of COVID or potentially planning on as you finalize budgets for the rest of the year?Well, we've not announced any plans for layoffs or furloughs. With respect to other cost reduction measures, we're always looking for additional opportunities to operate more efficiently. And as I indicated in our prepared remarks, during our recent period of displacement tied to the COVID, we've certainly identified a number of ways to work smarter. And we're going to upside those going forward to make us a stronger company.Great. Thank you.Our next question will come from the line of Paul Golding with Macquarie Capital.Thanks so much for taking my question. I guess, I was hoping to see if there was some color you might be able to provide on the virtual MVPD front, whether there's been any progress there or any news you can talk to around conversations, increase in distribution? Thanks so much.Adam?Yes, sure. Iâ€™ll take this one. So on the virtual MVPD side, we're pleased that our networks were included in the launch of the new AT&T TV service this past fiscal year. That's a service, obviously, AT&T has invested in, and they're optimistic about. And of course, we're continuing to pursue incremental distribution opportunities. We're not going to get into specifics about the nature or details about any discussions. But I would also just say on the virtual MVPD front, it's an evolving but small segment of the pay television universe. And frankly, with â€“ when coupled with broadband, the price point of some of these offerings has been driven up to be comparable to or in some instances greater than the pricing that you see from traditional distributors and with substantially fewer channels.  So we believe the value proposition for some of these guys has become questionable. And â€“ but that being said, of course, we're focusing on all opportunities for incremental distribution for our content.Thanks.The next question will come from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.Thank you very much. Just two questions. First, just following-up on your commentary about your different start dates potentially for the 2021 NBA season. Would did December start to that season, create an impact or shift to your distribution revenue or the cost in general? If you can maybe elaborate on that a little bit? I know you touched on the advertising side. And then my second question is, I'm not sure how much comment, but some recent press reports about the Devils were looking to buy sports New York. I'm curious if you see any risk to Devils renewal with MSG Networks on that will comes out in a few years?Hi Alexia, so â€“ itâ€™s Bret. Iâ€™ll take the first one. I think â€“ so we did highlight that there are certainly\n",

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Jeff [Indiscernible] of FNK IR. Please go ahead.Thank you, Devin.

Doug, the call is yours.Thank you, Jeff, and good morning everyone. Despite the significant challenges presented by the COVID-19 situation, our second quarter results with much stronger June net sales in April and May provide continued evidence that we remain boldly back on track. In June, we generated $10 million of our $14.8 million quarterly sales. With July's net sales exceeding June, we see a continued strengthening in our customer demand. While we ramped up production from the very low April and May levels, we're effectively able to maintain overall operational and SG&A cost discipline. In the second quarter, our SG&A costs, including an $0.3 million severance charge, were $6.3 million compared to $5.9 million in the first quarter, and $7.4 million in the second quarter of 2019.  Despite the significant challenges over the last month, our operational and commercial improvements will continue to move the business positively forward. We have rebuilt the earnings power of Unique Fabricating, and as the automotive industry rebounds, we are well-positioned for continued success. Based upon the foundational work laid over the last 10 months, the leadership team and entire organization are ready to deliver EBITDA improvement, debt reduction, and sales growth. With the strong relationship we have with our bank syndicate, we achieved successful agreements regarding our new loan amendment, providing sufficient liquidity in revised covenants. Combined with our operational improvements, the new amendment provides a firm basis for the company to focus its efforts fully on profitable growth going forward. Regarding the COVID-19 impact on our business and our corresponding actions, we continue to follow the guidelines regarding a safe work environment provided by the various governmental entities in the jurisdictions where we operate and have taken additional measures to protect our employees. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the unprecedented and evolving situation, including the production plants of our various customers, we are unable to determine the full impact of the COVID-19 situation on our future operations. We've maintained our current plans based upon the latest third-party provided North America automotive production outlook for approximately 12.4 million units versus the 16.5 million forecast at the start of the year. This indicates North America second half light vehicle volume production to be approximately 7.2 million units or 90% of the original 2020 forecast. The July and August releases we have seen from our automotive customers do support this production outlook. In line with this increasing demand, we added back resources prudently. As a result, we ramped up our plant production to operate more cost effectively than we did before COVID-19. We continue our discretionary spending rationalization -- reduction or elimination.  Regarding the COVID-19 impact on our second quarter business, the dramatic curtailment of automotive shipments in Q2, reduced net sales by approximately 24.1 million, or 62% from Q2 2019 despite more than 1.4 million new PPE product sales for the healthcare and manufacturing sectors, April and May respectively saw net sales of 2 million and 2.8 million while June did see a higher than expected increase to 10 million, resulting in second quarter net sales of 14.8 million, which are above the previously communicated 14 million. Our Mexico operations we started in June that are now near full production, as are all of our other facilities. In summary, the COVID-19 impact on our second quarter was significant. However, our cost reduction efforts, our pivot to new manufacturing of PPE, and our ability to react quickly helped us navigate this challenging time. We saw significant June volume improvement, which continued into July with 10.8 million net sales. The June and July increased volumes and our ability to deliver positive operating income on those improved, but still modest volumes, reinforce our confidence that the worst is behind us and that our actions taken over the last 10 months have positioned us very well for success going forward. Next, I will discuss our current and future key business activities and highlights. We completed the sale of our previously owned Evansville facility for a net $0.85 million and executed a sublease agreement for a portion of the Evansville facility leased through 2022. We took a non-cash restructuring charge of $0.1 million for the building site. Combined with the disposal of certain equipment as part of our continuing operational review, we incurred a total of $0.3 million in non-cash restructuring expenses in the second quarter.  From the remaining organizational realignment and upgrades, primarily in our Mexico operations, we incurred $0.3 million in severance cost in the second quarter with an expected $0.6 million annual cost savings. We have now completed our location and organizational targeted restructuring activities with no expectation of further cash restructuring costs. We completed our realignment of the commercial teams with our transportation appliance, medical, and consumer/off-road market approach. With the recent additions to our executive staff noted in our prior earnings call, we now have a complete, experienced leadership team and an organizational structure capable of executing the various activities for us to achieve our strategy and meet our operational and commercial targets. We implemented our new CRM or Customer Relationship Management tool to facilitate all aspects of our commercial activities. We've already seen an improvement in the information available to our teams as we continue to develop our customer relationships and capitalize on commercial opportunities. In late July, we updated our Investor page linked to our new website, as part of our ongoing efforts to improve the information provided to our stakeholders. As a continuation of activities to produce new PPE for the medical and manufacturing communities, with 1.4 million in second quarter sales, we began production of N95 facemask in July in our Auburn Hills facility. We are evaluating the longer term potential for these new products as part of our overall growth target for the medical markets to be 10% of our total sales for the mid-term. With approximately 94 million in customer order intake or COI through the second week of August, we continue our success and winning new business in our targeted markets, including a large recent award of a new-to-unique application of a Class A fire retardant reaction injection molded engine [Indiscernible]. Based upon our ongoing commercial and operational improvement activities, we remain certain that we have opportunities to grow our share organically in each of the markets we have chosen to serve. Our new hires will enable us to further enhance our product and service offerings, as well as to develop longer term strategic supplier relationships. We are confident that the team additions and the completed organization realignment enable us to create and communicate our unique selling points in our existing as well as our new targeted markets. Unique Fabricating remains boldly back on track. It is in a stronger position now to realize the identified commercial opportunities and to build on the sustainable operational improvements made to-date. Brian will now provide an overview of our second quarter financial results.Thank you, Doug. Good morning, everyone. Net sales for the second quarter of 2020 decreased to 14.8 million, down 62% or 24.1 million from 38.9 million during the second quarter last year. Our April and May 2020 sales totaled 4.8 million as our transportation customers' facilities were idle due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. June net sales were 10 million or 68% of our total net sales for the second quarter of 2020. Of the 14.8 million in net sales for the second quarter, customers in the transportation market accounted for approximately 75%, appliance at approximately 14%, with the remaining 11%, primarily attributable to the medical market as we transition some of our manufacturing capacity to personal protection equipment. Gross profit for the second quarter was $1.7 million or 11.8% of net sales compared to $8.2 million or 21.1% of net sales for the same period of 2019. The decrease in gross profit was due to the loss contribution margin on the 24.1 million lower sales, partially offset by reduced structural and other overhead costs.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2020 were down $1.1 million to $6.3 million compared to $7.4 million for the second quarter of 2019. The decrease in SG&A results from several cost reductions, including management headcount, commissions, and professional services in addition to the savings from plant closures, which were partially offset by $0.3 million of salaried severance costs recognized in the second quarter of 2020. Operating loss was $4.8 million for the second quarter of 2020 compared to an operating loss of $6.7 million for the same period last year. The decrease in operating loss was primarily due to the $6.8 million impairment of goodwill recognized in the second quarter of 2019, which did not recur in 2020 in addition to $1.1 million lower SG&A and $0.4 million lower restructuring expenses. The loss contribution margin on the 24.1 million lower net sales in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to 2019 more than offset the lower impairment, SG&A, and restructuring expense. Interest expense was $0.6 million for the second quarter of 2020 compared to $1.3 million for the second quarter last year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the impact of the reduced total debt levels, lower expenses related to our interest rate swap, and the composition of our debt compared to last year, as the PPP loan has an interest rate of 1%. Net loss for the second quarter of 2020 was $4.3 million or $0.44 per basic and diluted share compared to $7.6 million or $0.78 per basic and diluted share in the second quarter of 2019. The net loss is the result of the impact of the 24.1 million lower net sales partially offset by the lower SG&A, impairment, restructuring, and interest expenses. I will now provide an update on the financial -- on our financial position and liquidity. Net debt or total debt, less cash and cash equivalents, decreased $5.4 million to $45.8 million as of June 30th, 2020, inclusive of $4.7 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to $51.2 million as of June 30th, 2019, inclusive of $1.1 million of cash and cash equivalents Since year-end, net debt has decreased $1 million inclusive of $0.7 million of cash and cash equivalents at December 29th, 2019. The increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to the $6 million loan we received in April as part of the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program. During the second quarter, we use $3.5 million of the PPP loan proceeds for allowed expenses as defined in the CARES Act, which left $2.5 million in cash and cash equivalents at June 30. By the end of July, we had fully exhausted the proceeds. We expect to apply for forgiveness no later than October, and we believe a substantial portion, if not all of the PPP loan will be forgiven. As we have not gone through the forgiveness application process or any audits related to forgiveness, there is inherent uncertainty to what amount of the PPP loan will ultimately be forgiven. In addition to our earnings announcement this morning, we also announced that we had successfully completed the Eighth Amendment to our credit agreement on August 7. The Seventh Amendment, which we completed in April, waived our financial covenant requirements for the second quarter. As we anticipated the COVID-19 pandemic would significantly impact our financial results. We knew that the waiver provided by the Seventh Amendment did not address our ongoing covenant needs. The Eighth Amendment resets our financial covenants, beginning with the third quarter of 2020, which excludes the second quarter of 2020 results from our future covenant compliance calculations. We ended the quarter with $4.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $0.7 million of net availability on our revolving line of credit. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations. And we've remained focused on controlling discretionary spend, and capital expenditures, so we can generate strong cash flows to deleverage the company.  Doug will now provide some closing remarks. Doug, back to you.Thank you, Brian. It remains our intent to meet with many of you virtually or if possible in person over the next year, and circumstances allowed. Through the significant challenges we have faced over the last months, the Unique team has not just survived, but in fact has continued to improve all aspects of our commercial and operating performance. We've established a strong foundation to meet our ambitious targets and stakeholder expectations for profitable growth as we deliver significant shareholder value. As we continue on our path to realizing our boldly back on track vision, are now complete management team and our employees are excited about the opportunities then we have in front of us. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator?At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of John Nobile with Taglich Brothers. Please proceed with your questions.Good morning, Doug and Brian. Thanks for the call and taking my questions. We appreciate it. I'd like to know if you could comment on how your current auto related business is looking now that we're almost halfway into the third quarter, I know, you had mentioned that total business was a 10.8 in July, but the couple of weeks extra here if you could talk just specifically about the auto related business?Okay. So again, as we've mentioned in here a few different times, everything we say is with a certain amount of caution and reservation. You and everybody else on this call was familiar with the inherent uncertainty that exists right now with the changing outlook relative to closures, et cetera. But again, we communicated the July sales, we thought that was important. 10.8 million which was above the 10 million in June, through August, we're seeing similar trends. And as I indicated in the overall outlook using the production, third-party provider production, again and based on what we see today this trend can continue. I guess, the best way that I would say.Okay. I had a feeling in August would be a better trend, a better numbers in the one of related business so versus July. I know you didn't provide the break on us for your total business, which talks about your appliance business also. But actually, the same question I can ask you is in regard to your appliance business, how is that shaping up now halfway through the quarter?Yes. So again, thanks for the question. And again, I appreciate the understanding that we do have a somewhat diversified business, absolutely is concentrated in transportation. But we're working diligently to diversify that somewhat as we move forward. As we've indicated before, what I've said in the earnings release itself, is that we also see very positive trends, macro and specific to our customers related to appliance, whether that is supporting the very strong housing market, both new housing and refurbishments. A lot of businesses being done there, and anecdotally, I can say that, we have evidence of people trying to get washer dryers and refrigerators that are on backorder. So, we see a strong outlook, at least for our visibility over the next 60 days, and then that part of the business too. But it also remains subject to all the different things. And this is clearly supported by the very low interest rate environment that we have which also can change, but that business remains strong at this point in time, as does relatively strong as the transportation business.Okay. Thanks for that. That sounds encouraging. And are you still targeting about 10% of your total sales to come from the medical market in the mid-term? I think last quarter you alluded to the fact that midterm I think you're looking at like 18 month to 24 month period here. Are we looking at that still 10% to come from it?Yeah. I would tell you that is clearly the target that we have internally, and we have restructured our commercial team to be able to access and deliver that, that certainly is more whitespace than what we have in our transportation and our appliance business. And appreciate your noting the mid-term comment that we're looking to be there, we would say no later than the actual end of 2022. Because it does take some time to get started in that and that remains our target. As I noted previously, again, we are doing the face mask production, the N95 that it started, but it started at the very end of July. We're in production now. And we are assessing the longer term efficacy of what that business can be and that would certainly provide a foundation\n",

      "4. Welcome to Teekay Corporation's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call. During the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, you will be invited to participate in a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Now, for the opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Company. Please go ahead.Before we begin, I'd like to direct all participants to our website at www.teekay.com, where you'll find a copy of the second quarter of 2020 earnings presentation. Kenneth And Vince will review this presentation during today's conference call. Please allow me to remind you that our discussion today contains forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from results projected by those forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the second quarter 2020 earnings release and earnings presentation available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Kenneth to begin.Thank you, Ryan. Hello, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us today for Teekay Corporation's second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. I hope that you and your families are all safe and healthy. On the call today, I'm joined by Vince Lok, Teekay's group CFO. Before we get into our results, I'd again like to take a moment to thank all of our seafarers and shore-based staff for their continued and extraordinary dedication to maintain business continuity. The unprecedented impact of COVID-19 continues to be a major area of focus for us, but we have thus far successfully navigated the evolving logistical and regulatory challenges, with minimal impact on our operations. We're truly proud and thankful of how our seafarers and on-shore colleagues have responded to COVID-19, implementing new standards to ensure the continued health and well-being of everyone involved in our organization, especially our colleagues at sea, while maintaining consistently safe and efficient operations for our customers. Moving to our recent highlights on Slide 3 of the presentation. In the second quarter of 2020, we reported our third consecutive quarterly adjusted profit, recording consolidated adjusted net income of $40 million or $0.39 per share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $13 million or $0.13 per share in the same period of the prior year. We also generated a total adjusted EBITDA of $316 million, an increase of $119 million, or 61%, from the same period of last year. Our strong results in the second quarter can be attributed to solid earnings in each of our main businesses. Teekay LNG reported another quarterly record high in adjusted net income and total adjusted EBITDA. Teekay Tankers experienced another quarter of strong spot tanker rates, and our directly owned FPSO operating results improved as a result of the new bareboat charter contract secured in late March on the Foinaven FPSO, which eliminated our exposure to the previous lossmaking contract. Looking ahead to next quarter, we expect Teekay LNG will continue Earning stable cash flows, as a result of its LNG fleet being fully fixed through the rest of 2020. At Teekay Tankers, the spot tanker market has come under pressure since mid-May, following three quarters of strong spot tanker rates. The near-term outlook for the tanker market is uncertain at this point, and to some degree, linked to the global oil production and demand, which presently is about 10% lower than the average demand in 2019. In our tanker business, we continue to follow the prudent path that we laid out at our Investor Day last November, and we're pleased to have significantly reduced our effective free cash flow breakevens and near-term spot exposure by locking in 23% of the tanker fleet on fixed rate contracts at attractive rates, and we are encouraged by fleet supply fundamentals, which are favorable, relative to prior market cycles. Finally, we have now commenced the wind down of the second of our three FPSOs, which are no longer core business. The Banff FPSO seized production on its field in June 2020, and we have commenced the various decommissioning and subsea remediation procedures on the field, which I will touch on in more detail on the next slide.  We continue to utilize these improved cash flows to further strengthen our financial foundation, which is one of our strategic priorities. Over the past year, we have reduced our consolidated net debt by $887 million, or 20%, which creates significant equity value throughout the group. We've also increased our total consolidated liquidity to approximately $940 million as of June 30, which provides financial strength and flexibility. Lastly, we have also secured bank commitments for a new equity margin revolver of up to $150 million to refinance Teekay Corporation's existing revolver that is currently undrawn and matures in December 2020 at substantially similar terms. We continue to further simplify our structure. With the refinancing of Teekay Tankers four Suezmax tankers this month, we have eliminated all our remaining guarantees of dollar company debt, which stood at over $225 million just two years ago. And as announced in May, we eliminated the Incentive Distribution Rights or IDRs we held in Teekay LNG, in exchange for $10.75 million TGP common units. Lastly, and most importantly, the health and safety of our crew and shore staff is paramount for the Teekay group. We have implemented strict measures on all of our vessels to protect our seafarers, while the vast majority of our shore staff are working remotely from home. As a result of the pandemic, the overall maritime industry has experienced significant challenges related to crew changes, but I'm pleased to report that we have managed to at least do a partial refresh of our crews on effectively all of our vessels, and our teams are focused on minimizing the number of crews that are overdue. We'll continue to work hard with both the industry and inter-governmental organizations to tackle this challenge and bring our remaining overdue colleagues home safely as soon as possible. I'm truly proud of how our seafarers and on-shore colleagues have responded to ensure safe and successful transitions, with no reported COVID-19 cases, while providing uninterrupted service to our customers. Turning to Slide 4, we continue with the wind down of our FPSO segment, as we discussed at our Investor Day in November. In late March, we secured a new up to 10-year bareboat contract on the Foinaven that effectively covers the remaining life and the eventual green cycling of the unit. We'll receive $6 million to $7 million of cash pursuant to this new contract in April. in addition, we'll receive a nominal per day fee for the contract life that effectively covers any ancillary costs and a lump sum payment at the end of the contract term that is expected to cover any cleanup and green recycling costs of the unit. Importantly, this new contract eliminates our operational exposure to the previous lossmaking contract. The Banff seized production on its field in June and is expected to come off the existing field during the third quarter of 2020, with green recycling of the unit expected to be completed by the end of the year. The Banff has a unique contract structure, where Teekay is also responsible for part of the remediation of the subsea infrastructure. We've been accruing for these costs on our balance sheet, with a current net asset retirement obligation or ARO of $44 million, which is net of an $8 million receivable balance that is to be funded by the customer. Roughly half of this net ARO is expected to be incurred in 2020, with the remaining to be carried out in the summer of '21, as part of a two-phase subsea remediation process. In addition to the ARO costs, we are also expecting to continue to incur certain operating costs associated with the decommissioning of the FPSO and FSO units, most of which we expect will be incurred in the third quarter of 2020, coinciding with when we expect the unit to leave the Banff field. Lastly, the Hummingbird FPSO, which just completed a planned customer-funded shutdown for maintenance, continues to operate on its fixed rate contract, and is currently producing approximately 7,000 barrels per day.  Over the next two slides, I'll briefly touch on the results and highlights of our daughter companies. I would encourage you to listen to the respective earnings conference calls for more details following this call. On Slide 5, we have summarized Teekay LNG's recent results and highlights. Teekay LNG Partners reported another record high adjusted net income and total adjusted EBITDA during the quarter, generating total adjusted EBITDA of $192 million and adjusted net income of $63 million or $0.67 per unit, up significantly compared to the same period of the prior year, as a result of a complete quarter contribution in Q2 from its fully delivered growth program. Q2 also marked the eighth consecutive quarterly increase in total adjusted EBITDA. TGP's LNG fleet is 100% fixed for the remainder of 2020 and 94% fixed in '21. TGP's average daily fixed charter rate in 2020 is expected to be above $80,500 per day, which compares very favorably compared to the weak current LNG spot market. To be clear, this $80,500 per day figure is the rate earned on a 100% utilization basis because of the time charter nature of the employment. In addition, TGP has also reaffirmed its 2020 adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income guidance. Lastly, TGP continues to further de-lever its balance sheet and make steady progress towards achieving its target leverage reigns of 4.5 times to 5.5 times on a net debt to total adjusted EBITDA basis. In May, TGP repaid it's not bond maturity with existing cash, and on a second quarter analyzed basis, TGP ended off at 5.9 times on a net debt to total adjusted EBITDA basis, which includes proportionate share of its underlying joint ventures, which is significantly improved from 7.2 times in 2019. With a strengthening financial foundation and deleveraging that is expected to provide financial flexibility, market leading positions, and a very compelling valuation at a 4.5 times PE ratio, based on the midpoint of TGP's 2020 EPU guidance, we believe that TGP has significant long-term value potential, which benefits Teekay as the largest common unit holder. For every 10% increase in TGP's unit price, Teekay's equity interest would increase by $0.45 per Teekay share, or 16%, based on yesterday's closing price of $2.74 per share. Please see the appendix to this presentation for more details. Turning to Slide 6, Teekay Tankers reported its third consecutive quarter of strong earnings and cash flows. In Q2 TNK generated total adjusted EBITDA of $124 million, up from $36 million in the same period of the prior year, and adjusted net income of $81 million, or $2.39 per share in the second quarter, a significant improvement from an adjusted net loss of $12 million or $0.36 per share in the same period of the prior year. TNK has transformed its balance sheet, bringing its net debt down to $549 million, a decrease of over $180 million or 25% in the second quarter alone, and increase its total liquidity to $468 million as of June 30. Over the past three quarters, TNK has reduced its net debt by $448 million or 45%. In addition, and as mentioned in my opening remarks, TNK has secured a new $67 million debt financing, secured by four suezmax tankers to refinance a debt facility maturing in 2021, which eliminated the last remaining daughter company debt guaranteed by Teekay Corp. Teekay TNK now has no debt maturities until 2023. Since reporting in May, TNK has delivered nine vessels onto previously announced time charter contracts, bringing its total number of fixed vessels to 13, or a total of 23% of the fleet. These fixed contracts log in rates at attractive levels and reduce its spot fleets free cash flow breakeven to $12,700 per day through mid-2021, which means the Company is expected to earn positive free cash flow in almost any tanker market. With a low free cash flow breakeven, as a result of reasonably well-timed fixed rate charter contracts, a strong liquidity position, low balance sheet leverage, and no debt maturities until 2023, we believe that Teekay Tankers is financially well positioned for any near-term volatility in the tanker market. The near term prospects in the crude tanker market are currently unclear, but we take comfort from the fact that the order book has remained well below levels seen in earlier recoveries, limiting vessel supply growth over the next two to three years. Lastly, for every 10% increase in TNK's unit price, Teekay's equity interest would increase by $0.15 per Teekay share of 5% based on yesterday's closing price of $2.74 per share.  In summary, for every 10% increase in TGP and TNK's share prices, Teekay's equity interest would increase by $0.60 per Teekay share, or 22%, based on yesterday's closing price of $2.74 per share. Please see the appendix to this presentation for more details. I'll now turn the call over to Vince.Thanks, Ken. Turning to Slide 7. Over the past year, we have significantly strengthened our financial foundation. This includes de-levering our balance sheet, increasing our cash flows, and improving our profitability. We have reduced our consolidated net debt to $3.5 billion at the end of June, a decrease of $887 million or 20%. We reduced our consolidated net debt to cap from 62% to 57%, and increased our total consolidated liquidity to approximately $940 million compared to $644 million a year ago. On the last 12 months or LTM basis, our total adjusted EBITDA was $1.18 billion, an increase of $298 million or 34% from the same period of the prior year. This included consolidated G&A savings of $10 million, or 11%. We have also significantly improved our profitability, as we recorded consolidated adjusted net income of $72 million or $0.71 per share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $40 million or $0.39 per share in the prior period. Our LTM Q2 '20 adjusted earnings per share of $0.71 translates to a PE ratio of only 3.9 times, based on Teekay's closing share price of yesterday. Looking ahead, as usual, we have provided some guidance on next quarter's results in the appendix to this presentation. Compared to the strong results in the second quarter, we expect the third quarter's results to be lower, as a result of seasonally lower spot tanker rates, but also due to some temporary factors, such as the decommissioning costs on the Banff FPSO and a much heavier than normal level of scheduled dry dockings in Q3, the latter of which was strategically timed, with the expected seasonally weaker Q3 spot tanker rates. However, we would expect our earnings and cash flows to become more normalized in the fourth quarter, with significantly lower decommissioning costs on the Banff FPSO, a much lighter dry docking schedule, and the potential for some tanker rate spikes to occur in the winter months. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Kenneth for his closing comments.Thanks, Vince. In closing, the full effects of the COVID pandemic on the global economy remain unknown. However, over the last year, Teekay Corp, Teekay LNG, and Teekay Tankers have each strengthened their financial positions and made significant progress insulating each of the businesses from possible market volatility and positioning the Teekay group to create long-term shareholder value. With that, operator, we are now available to take questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from J Mintzmyer with Value Investor's Edge.Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my calls, and congrats on strong daughter company performance.Morning, J.Thanks, J.As Teekay Corp continues this transition, we've done the GPIDR buyout, it's basically just a holding company with daughter shares, and two FPSOs on their way out. We saw some slides on that in the presentation. Along those notes, we asked last quarter, but just to check up again, what is the G&A that's not reimbursed? What is the core parent G&A and how can we consider that on annual basis? I realize that fluctuates quarter to quarter, but what is sort of the only -- the parent company overhead that we still have to deal with?Hi, J. This is Vince. The second quarter G&A of the parent was higher than normal because of some tips and one-time factors. We had some fees related to the IDR transaction that was completed in May, and we also had stock-based grants that were issued in June. So if you look at the first half G&A for the parent on a more normalized basis, excluding those items, we're looking at about probably around $5 million. We also had other income that offset that total about $5.5 million for the first half. So looking at the first half, our net G&A was actually pretty much zero. Now, the other income in the first half was probably higher than normal. So if I normalize that on a full-year basis, I would expect our net G&A for the full year would be about $6 million to $7 million on a net basis. That's sort of the run rate.Okay. Thanks, Vince. That's pretty helpful. So $6 million to $7 million annualized. And is that reasonable to say that would be going forward for '21 and beyond? Or is that a little bit elevated because of the FPSOs?No, the G&A related to the FPSOs is separate in the FPSO line items. So the $6 million to $7 million is good in terms of the corporate level.Okay. Thanks, Vince. Turning to the FPSOs, you talked about the Banff. It has a $44 million asset retirement obligation that's been disclosed for a while. I realize you kind of already accounted for that in the income statement. The first part of that is how does that impact your cash balances? How much of that is already kind of reserved in separate accounts? And how much of that would pull directly from Teekay parent's cash balance? And then the second part of that is, of course, you noted there might be some additional OpEx and recycling fees associated. What do you anticipate that net cost to be for the recycling? I understand green recycling is a little more expensive in addition to that $44 million. So how much above that $44 million are we going to go?First of all, we have a fairly strong liquidity position at the parent. It was about $170 million as of June 30. And when we complete the refinancing of the existing revolver, that should go up to close to $200 million. So we have good a good strong liquidity position at the parent. As you mentioned, the net ARO or asset retirement obligation at June 30 was about $44 million. We expect roughly half of that to be incurred in in this year, and then the rest of it in the summer of 2021. In terms of other operating expenses, we're estimating that to be roughly about $20 million on top of that in the third quarter, and that's mainly related to the decommissioning of the FPSO and the FSO unit. We might then -- looking at the fourth quarter, in terms of recycling costs, we don't have a good number yet on that. We're still getting some estimates and scoping out what's required for that. That's likely to be incurred in the fourth quarter. I would expect it to be probably in the -- sort of a few million dollars or so.Okay. Well, we'll have to check in next quarter and see where that goes. Along those lines, you have a very sufficient liquidity balance, as you mentioned. You have to revolver rolled. You have a very high cost of debt remaining on the Company outside of that revolver, right? You have the 9.25% secured bonds, and you also have a convertible bond that's only 5%. But it trades on the open market at about a 13% yield to maturity. I mean, this is at a time where the majority of even your shipping peers, even\n",
